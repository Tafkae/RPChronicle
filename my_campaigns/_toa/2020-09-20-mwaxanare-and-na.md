*our heroes cause an international incident*

-----

teacher isn't accepting guests today.
wait until summoned.
    is this part of the test also?
    well, we'll wait.

so we're hanging around town.

creed & co stop in to see the "princess".
first we run into Na, a young boy (6) in feathered costume.
    he is human! interesting.
Na is wearing an Omuan family crest!
    Omu being the lost city now taken over by Yuan-ti and necromancer.
    Na is pleased that Creed recognizes it.
there's a lot of Omuan tapestries as well.

we're invited upstairs, to a small bedroom.
there's a curtain dividing it, unevenly.
lots of luxury goods etc.

**princess Mwaxanar√©** is 17-ish.
demands that we bow.
creed respectfully declines.

mwax says creed is rude, alatu is gross.
comes over to lureene and starts letting her hair down.
    lureene isn't sure what to do.
    takes her hair away after mwax acts like she doesn't care about her people.

how came you here? says creed.
    father died in accident (fell from the cliffs).
    mother eaten by pterafolk.
    her people: all dead.

omuans mysteriously vanished 105 years ago.
yuan-ti moved into Omu 50 years ago.
something's not adding up here.
she doesn't seem to be LYING, she definitely THINKS she's princess/queen of omu.
    and certainly seems to THINK Teacher is under her thumb...

creed and alatu leave with Na, to have a chat.
(about how shitty his sister is.)
they have a roof garden that Na tends.
he admires the aarakocra and wants to be more like them.
"theyv'e been so nice to us over the century.
took my great-great grandparents in,
allowed them and their descendants to live here
until we can return to Omu."
it's clear he's very intelligent and wise beyond his years.
he'll be a good ruler, if he becomes ruler!
    but mwax is the heir, WHOOPS.
he makes little leo da vinci flying machines for funsies.

lureene stays with mwax.
she's not chill with how the princess treated her friends.
mwax: what can your QUEEN do for you?
lureene: i wanted to find out more about you and your people.
    the omuans vanished over a hundred years ago.

it turns out mwax has no idea what's going on in the world outside kir sabal.
lureene fills her in on the fact that nobody outside chult has heard of her,
and also the death curse.
at first mwax doesn't believe her, says she must be a dumb peasant girl.
lureene shows her signet ring, proving she is in fact nobility.
mwax gets mad at ashara and runs off in a huff, knocking the door off its hinges.

alatu doesn't respect mwax cause she clearly hasn't been taking advantage of all the wise teachers to learn, but has been tricking the aarakocra for her own amusement.
which, yeah, that's pretty dickish.
but lureene can understand the whole "sheltered spoiled child" angle.

"Nangalore" - ancient garden, southwest of kir sabal.
Na wants to go there someday and see the flowers.
but we can't go there.
Ashara has forbidden the aarakocra from going there, reasons unknown.
    "hanging garden of dreams."

suddenly, horns ring out!
Na tells us this means gargoyles are attacking.
everybody who's not in the guard needs to stay inside.
    that's probably a good idea, since we'll die if we get knocked off the platforms.
creed wants to help but doesn't know where to go.
    asks Na about that, showing him his military insignia. "maybe i can help. who should i ask?"
    Na: this happens a lot, they usually have it under control. but you could try the training area, that's where the guards marshal.
Lureene offers to stay with Na and make sure he's safe.
Creed fixes the door first.
then he and Alatu head to the marshal point.

at this point, a formation of aarakocra are chasing off the gargoyles.
    there's nobody at the marshal point, they've already moved out.
so they head back to house.


why do the gargoyles attack?
    Na: idk, blood feud?
where do they come from?
    Na: apparently, they come from Omu.
    (what, like as citizens or as squatters?)


either way, we've got some Questions for Ashara.
    (though Na seems to think Ashara will be on Mwax's side.)

1. hey um have you been feeding the prince & princess wrong information?
2. why?
3. why let her make your people do that dumb tomato ritual?
   we know she only instituted it as a prank.
4. what's the deal with nangalore?
5. now that we've come into your house and pissed off the princess and interrogated you,
   can you teach us how to fly please

this can only end well
