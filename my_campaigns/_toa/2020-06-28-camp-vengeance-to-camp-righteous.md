## Day 28

The party, forced to surrender, were brought before Niles Breakbone, who told them they'd be punished for their "insubordination." They were then tied up and handcuffed while Breakbone went elsewhere, leaving two paladins in shining gold armor (his lieutenants) to watch them.

The lieutenants, a female human named Pern and a male dwarf named Ord, were willing to talk a bit with the captives. Creed asked what happened to Molly, and was told she was being treated for her injuries and would be brought here afterward. Lureene asked what was going to happen to them all, and was told they'd be tried, with the implication that the penalty was execution.

As promised, Molly was brought in to join the others, all healed up. From the healer, Sister Cyas, the party learned that the healers here were spread thin. Disease was running rampant in the camp, particularly one called "mad monkey fever," which is spread by a blue mist in this jungle full of undead. The clerics were so exhausted they were having trouble regaining their spell slots.

* **But how did it end up like this?** How did they end up so deep in the jungle with no support or supply lines? Pern answers that, as members of the Order of the Gauntlet, they've been tasked with destroying all undead everywhere. 
* **What happened?** Initially they were based out of Camp Righteous, but it wasn't as defensible, and they were overrun by the undead. The survivors retreated and established Camp Vengeance. But with the blue mist constantly pouring in from Aldani Basin, they couldn't recover.
* **Why was Breakbone put in charge, considering how unstable he seems?** Well, only the higher-ups in Neverwinter would be able to answer that. Lureene suspected they were just trying to get rid of him.

As a veteran paladin, Creed offered his expertise in fixing up the camp, improving drainage and so on to help flatten the curve. This offer was accepted.

Overnight, Creed snuck back in and undid some of the party's bonds, but the group was caught before they could even get out of the tent. Luckily, the paladins accepted the excuse that they were just trying to set up bug repellent, and looked the other way when the party shared a block of the incense with them.

## Day 29

The party overheard an argument taking place outside the tent about what to do with the prisoners. Breakbone was dead-set on executing them. Pern and Cyas advocated for the party, while Ord deferred to Breakbone's authority. In the end, they failed to change Breakbone's mind, but Pern and Ord returned to the party and offered to let them leave *right now*. (They also quickly gave the party some bugspray and pitons in exchange for rations.)

Unfortunately, the party was spotted on the way out, and couldn't reach the gate before the paladins caught up to them. Lureene used Color Spray to blind Breakbone, though, which bought them *just* enough time to escape.

They rowed their boat back to the waiting Azaka and Dennis. When Azaka heard their story, she simply said, "I told you so." It seemed unlikely Breakbone would be able to muster a real search effort, but they hid the boats at night anyway as they headed deeper into the jungle.

## Day 30

River travel, uneventful.

## Day 31

Following the river, the party returned to Camp Righteous. In their absence, though, it appeared there'd been some goblin foot traffic in the area. They'd come out of the woods and loitered in camp a while, from the looks of it, but then suddenly bolted *back* to the woods, leaving their weapons behind. What could they have been running from? Azaka chalked it up to goblins being cowards, and Dennis (as a goblin) agreed. Nevertheless, the party decided to double up on watch that night.

That turned out to be a good idea. Early in the night, Creed roused the party as a group of three old women approached their camp. It seemed strange that they'd be out here alone, but they seemed like regular old women, albeit dirty and dressed in rags. Could they be natives? Creed offered the ladies some rations, but as he went to hand them over, one of the women grabbed him by the arm and pulled him close, looking deep into his eyes. *"This will do,"* she said... and Creed dropped like a sack of bricks, immediately unconscious.

With that, the women's glamour fell apart, revealing them for the decrepit, withered husks they truly were. Lureene, recognizing them as hags, attacked.

**Highlight reel**

* Alatu got offended. The party "passed their test" and they attacked anyway? *Rude.*
* Molly's cold breath didn't do much, but she actually managed to scare one with a Menacing Strike.
* Creed got resuscitated enough to heal himself.
* Lureene forced a hag backward, giving Creed an attack of opportunity and setting Azaka up for a wombo combo! Azaka then scored a critical hit with her scimitars. It wasn't enough to kill the thing, but it sure looked cool.
* Another hag dropped Molly with a single spell.
* Creed beheaded two hags in a single turn!
* Lureene attacked the final hag - a critical hit! - but Azaka swooped in too, with her sweet flips, and tried to steal her kill. "No way, Azaka, not this time!!"
* Realizing she was losing, the last hag tried to flee, and used magic to frighten Lureene and Azaka. However, when she tried to run, Molly and Creed both got attacks of opportunity and finished her off.

The rest of the night was uneventful, though Eridian was so sickened by the hags that she didn't get much sleep.
