*Our heroes leave the shrine of Obo'laka; they meet an old friend, and to make amends give up another*

---

The party finishes looking thru Obo'laka's shrine, then outside hears a huge explosion and Dennis shouting "I WANT TO LIIIIVE!"
Rushing outside, they find Dennis up a tree with the four zorbos trying to climb up after him. WELP.

* Lureene rushes in, nat 1's, throws away her sword, summons it back to her hand as a bonus action (YOU SAW NOTHING) and attacks for real.
* We quickly learn that the claws of zorbos will rust nonmagical armor if they hit!
* Alatu sets out a picnic blanket with food! Somehow this actually works on one of them. They *were* just hungry after all.
* The branch breaks and Dennis falls! But Creed rushes in and picks him up.
* Lureene gets the first kill :D
* The final zorbo turns to cannibalism before it's even safe. Lureene kills it too cause that's gross.

Dennis doesn't want to harvest the zorbo meat because it's gross.
Creed tries to harvest the rusting claws, and he gets 5 of them.

Eridian has a theory that the shrines are paired, so we're going to look for the shrine of I'jin the almiraj (bunny with a unicorn horn).

But before we can go looking at the palace, Eridian spots someone casting an ice spell far to the southwest, where there's stairs. This could be Mwaxanare!
    Reminder: If she dies, the Heart of Omu will become unsealed, and whoever's doing the Death Curse will have access to its power. So uh, that would be bad.
So let's go find her.

We fly over to that side of town. But before they reach the last ridge, Creed's wings disappear and he falls! Fortunately, Lureene swoops in and catches him.
One by one, everyone else's wings disappear too, but we all manage to land before we can fall.
Fortunately there are stairs up to the top of the cliff and we reach Building 1 just as the sounds of combat stop.

## Building 1: Old Guardhouse

On the other side of this building, the party hears voices and attempts to eavesdrop. However, everyone fails their Stealth roll.

We hear the voice of Artus Cember. Oh, he's our friend!
Eridian reveals herself, but inexplicably, Artus attacks Eridian with a dagger!
Creed and Molly had a vision dream about this happening.

Lureene attempts to disarm Artus, but he wings her with the knife instead. Fortunately, she can't be disarmed herself.

Alatu tries to work out what the fuck is going on.
Artus: Eridian's been messing with fate, it'll ruin everything I've been working on!
Eridian explains that, at the Oracle, she asked if there was anything she could do to help Azaka with a condition she couldn't cure. The Oracle gave me a Deck of Many Things, and I drew from it to try and help her. It made someone hate me, she says, and I guess now we know who it is.

* Alatu's familiar with superstitions surrounding the Deck of Many Things. It has the power to alter the fabric of reality. They're very rare. She basically feels like it's a cursed item.
* Creed's not familiar with the lore and is mad that Eridian used a Cursed item, but doesn't want Artus to kill her on account of the vision.
* Eridian tries to talk it out in terms of "our goals are still aligned even if you hate me."
* Artus refuses saying her actions have cause irreparable harm and he'll never see his wife again which is what he's been trying to do for the last *hundred fucking years*.
* Molly abruptly attacks Artus and manages to disarm him, and picks up the dagger. (It's *very* magical)
* Lureene tries to talk Artus down, being like "we're all on the same side!" Miraculously (20), she manages to. He's willing to stop if Eridian either dies or swears a life-bond to him. (Indentured servitude basically.)
* Alatu: can the wind dukes help?  
  Artus: i tried that, no they can't.
  Alatu: who can?
  Artus: who can unravel the fates? haha...
* Creed uses Divine Sense to see whether Artus is Good or Evil. It would appear he leans Good; his companion, Dragonbait, leans more strongly Good. Creed tries to negotiate, saying "Hey, hang on, we didn't know about Eridian's actions either until just now! Can't we talk about this?"
* Artus: *sigh.* okay maybe asking for her life is a little extreme. okay my new terms: A) Eridian becomes my servant until we find another way to Mesro, or B) I end my quest here and now.
    (what does that mean?)
    Creed says "hey your quest is noble and I'll help you after this."
    Artus: "Look I don't personally care about the Death Curse. All I want is to get back to Mesro."
    Creed: "What if the necromancer has more answers? He's pretty much the only one you haven't asked at this point."

But because of the Fate card, Artus needs an *immediate* resolution from Eridian specifically. No caveats, no buts.
The only other option is to kill Artus.
With those as their options, Eridian decides to go with Artus.

A strange darkness leaves Artus' eyes as she agrees. He thanks her.

"Goodbye for now, then?" Lureene shakes her hand. "It's been an honor."
    "Likewise," says Eridian.
Creed gives her a military dagger as a sign of respect.
Alatu: "You'd better be stronger when you get back!"
    Eridian: "That's the plan! You as well."

Creed tries to talk to Dragonbait, but Dragonbait can only talk to any given person once, ever.
Yes-or-no questions, then. "Do you have any leads?" No. "Do you know anything about the necromancer?" Points at Artus.

Lureene: If we find Raz Nsi here, we'll kill him. You have my word.
Artus: I appreciate it. He's always been beyond my reach, and it's not guaranteed that'll bring Mesro back. And since you promised that - Molly, you can keep that dagger. (Just let me un-attune it real quick.)
    The dagger's name is Bookmark.

Dragonbait offers to trade Lureene the Holy Avenger for the poison bow. Hell yeah!

Creed: Artus, what do you know about Acererak?
Artus: Acererak is the most powerful lich the world has ever seen. He could wipe you out with a flick of his little finger. Destroying his phylactery would not kill him, it would barely inconvenience him. I'm not going anywhere near that motherfucker.
Molly: Soooo we're not getting paid enough, basically.
Artus: Haha! Yeah, no amount of money would be enough.
Creed: Well, I have to try. Is there anything you can tell us that would help?
Artus: Uhhh it's hard to remember. But the legend of the 9 trickster gods is related to it. Each god has a temple here, and Acererak has rigged them all with traps to collect the souls of foolhardy adventurers. [He briefly feels the magic in the area.] There's a tomb beneath the city, where the 9 gods are entombed. It seems that's where he's gathering the souls to for his dark purpose.
Lureene: Are they really down there?
Artus: Iunno, maybe.
Creed: The heir of Omu lives, she flew here.
Artus: Oh, lol, on that airship I made for her?
Creed: *Why would you do that.*
Artus: Cause she has potential! She has powers waiting to be awakened.
Lureene: Do you know Locate Person or anything?
Artus: I don't, sorry. I don't do Divination.

Who were these guys fighting, anyway?
    Five yuan-ti malisons.
Artus says they work for Raz Nsi. They live in Omu.
By Lureene's estimate, they're gonna be tough. Very dense.

Creed shows Artus his handiwork with the zorbo claws attached to his mace.
Artus straight up laughs. "Yeah that's not gonna do anything."

## ERIDIAN HAS LEFT THE PARTY.

(Paul will be rolling a new character.)

---

Since it's getting late, the remaining party decides to make camp in this guardhouse.
It's a bit shit, and one wall's covered in graffiti (written in Common).
    This appears to be a popular stop for hapless adventurers.

> "Fear the fangs of Ras Nsi!"
> "Erik, I've gone in search of the nine shrines. V."
> "The puzzle cubes are the key."
> "Beware the frog monster!"
> "Who is Unkh?"
> "All hail the King of Feathers!"
> "The snakes are not what they seem."
> "Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?"

Lureene takes a long time etching it in, but adds "Lureene Tallstag was here" to the wall. That way, if she dies here, at least there's some proof of what happened to her.

She realizes, upon trying to attune to the Holy Avenger sword, that she *can't.* At this point Creed tells her only paladins can attune to it. "And you didn't tell me??" "Well, honestly I was jealous you were getting that thing."
But he offers to trade her his Mace of Disruption for it, and she reluctantly takes the trade. Alas.
She'll make it a bonded weapon as well.
