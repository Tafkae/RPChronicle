*Our heroes rest and regroup;*

## Sauna

Lureene and Karnassus hung out in the sauna for a few hours, until they were quite well-rested.

In the meantime, Karnassus struck up a light conversation with Lureene, asking her what her deal was. "What motivates you, what gets you up in the morning?" Lureene was reluctant to divulve her whole life story in front of this malison guy, but told him she initially came to Chult seeking adventure, and to prove herself.

Karnassus: "For fun?"
Lureene: "It was fun at the start. Now, though..."
Karnassus: "Not so much."
Lureene: "Mm. It's important, though - I have to see it through."

They spend the rest of their break more or less in silence, thinking about their life choices and stuff.

As they get up to leave, the malison says, "I like you."
Lureene *(sus)*: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Malison: "I hate when people make conversation while I'm trying to shed." He appreciates us shutting up, that is.

## Antechamber

Alatu had a seat and took a short rest.

Creed returned from... wherever he was, and regrouped with Alatu and Molly.

Ras Nsi escorted Molly back in from his chambers.
"Wait here while I get the gift you were promised."
He slithered up to the throne, pressed a button, and opened a secret compartment; inside was a cube, which he removed and handed to Molly.

About now, Lureene and Karnassus entered the room as well (with their Broodguard escort).
Ras Nsi: "Ah, your servants have returned. Which reminds me, your new maidservant!"
A malison returned, escorting Mwaxanare. She seems more alert now, and actually *relieved* to see Molly and co., by the looks of it.
    On her right arm is a new brand, in the shape of Molly's family crest bordered by a snake. (It doesn't appear to be magical - but Karnassus notices *she herself* seems to be magical. He does not mention this.)
Mwax clings to Molly's belt as they exit.

Molly declared we shall retire to our chambers, and orders some food (*without* people in it). Ras Nsi offers the party the use of a private room in the harem.

(I guess Lureene or Karnassus made a comment about the guy in the sauna?)
Ras Nsi: "Oh, that's Yahru. Yeah, he doesn't like being talked to while he's molting. One of his bodyguard would have probably killed you if you'd tried!"
Lureene: "O...oh."

Creed *reeeeeally* wants to kill everyone right now, but realizes this isn't the time.

---

## Harem Room

It's a cramped fit, but we all sort of fit in here with the cushions.

Mwaxanare broke down immediately. "I'm so glad you're here. I wasn't ready. I'm not prepared to rule Omu or the world. I just want to go home to Teacher."
She explained that everyone 

The party mentioned Na and she realized she'd sent him off for food and he never came back. Lureene started to tell her he's fine, we got him out, he's safe with-
Molly kinda cut Lureene off there, wanted to let Mwax squirm a little. Lureene was like "She's been through enough..."

Just then, a horrid screech echoed through the palace.
    Creed: "That'll be the hydra."
    Karnassus: "I think it's the triceratops, actually."
    Lureene: "There's a *hydra* in here??!"

### The Plan

The party then discussed the plan - Molly's agreement with Ras Nsi, how we are *absolutely* planning to double-cross him after we deal with Acererak, and so on.

At this point, Creed revealed where he disappeared to - he snuck around the corner and took some Dream Tincture. And he had a dream very much unlike the other dreams...


### Creed's Dream

> Saw eridian - speaking about the civilized goblin tribe (backstory connection)
> Creed is talking with 3 of his old army friends on patrol, Mander, Kim, and Tam
> Scouting the “civilized” goblin village
> Trying to convince friends that the goblins that they are scouting (and attacking) could be good.  Shared some experiences (vaguely) of Creed’s interactions with some other not-inherently-evil goblins and their potential to be worthy of inclusion, and possibly friendship.
> 
> Ants that are on the ground around us all immediately began burrowing straight down into the earth. Kim said “It’s like the ants of Widow Grote, wretched those sisters are.  There is no way the sisters can be redeemed.”
> 
> Upon hearing the name “Widow Grote”, Creed thinks of Nanny Pu'pu.  He is reminded of the old legends of the Sown Sisters - who can do creepy evil things to people in their sleep (steal their souls - possibly?).  The name that comes to mind immediately is Baggy Nana - a sister of Widow Grote.
> 
> Creed starts to melt into the ground - deep into the planet
> Eventually, Creed ends up in a massive cavern.
> No longer myself - now just here (out of body experience)
> 
> In the center of the room is a huge, disgusting, baby fetus thing (atropal)
> 3 wretched women are cooing, offering it food, trying to take care of this atropal
> 
> Widow Grote - Gold coins cover her eyes, covered in ants
> (Unknown Sister) - Wearing a necklace of human teeth, limping on a peg leg
> Baggy Nana - A leather sack over her head 
> 
> These women (night hags) are excited about getting all of the souls together and the unfathomable power they can get by doing so.
> 
> Baggy Nana pulls a terrier out of the sack on her head, which speaks for her - “There is so much potential for absolute destruction.”  The other two glare angrily - their goal is absolute destruction and they wish to reign over it all.
> 
> Creed feels an overwhelming presence enter the room - worst odor - pure evil - 
> Hear a booming voice - “...and how is our child coming?”
> Still a sense of dread, overwhelming

Creed told the party about the dream, though he wasn't really able to explain what an **atropal** is beyond "weird gross fetus." He had a theory that the Soulmonger might *be* the baby.

Lureene related the dream *she* had a while ago (see 2021-01-17).

Lureene and Karnassus know that atropals are ghastly, unfinished creations of evil gods, which the gods gave up on and cast adrift amidst the planes.
    Nothing can breathe true life into these creations.
    They might not count as *undead*, but they aren't alive either.
    Since they're unfinished, they can't live unassisted.
    They have to be nourished constantly by some extraplanar power, which is theorized to be the Negative Energy Plane.
    Uncertain: They may be able to draw power or summon creatures from the Negative Plane? But there *are* no creatures in the Negative Plane, that's the whole point.

And then, a guard comes in bearing a rack of Large Cooked Meats.
"Here you go: Not Human."
Lureene: "Whaaaat is it?"
Guard: "Triceratops!"
Alatu: "OH NO MY DINO."

Everyone eats the meats. *Especially* Creed.

It's past midnight/early morning at this point.
(Molly only took a short rest, so she takes a point of Exhaustion.)
(Creed didn't heal from the Dream Tincture, he just got a point of Exhaustion.)

# Day 71

What shall we do today?
* Karnassus knows where all the shrines are, so we can knock out a few of those today.
* We need to figure out a more secure place for Mwax and Na, just in case something happens to us. Ideally we should figure out a way to get them back to Kir Sabal.
* In the meantime, Mwax will come with us as proof of Ras Nsi's favor.

Ultimately, the party decided to leave through the front door, then double back and retrieve Dennis & co. from where they were hanging out.

On the way out, Molly summoned a servant to get them supplies and a map. The map  he provided was incomplete, it didn't have the Priests Only areas.

The main entrance/exit is north from the Hall of War.

## Palace

The party went to retrieve Dennis and co. from the secret entrance.
At first they didn't see them, but then Lureene (of all people) noticed a slight indentation in the ground, and pulled aside some bushes to find a small hand-dug hollow - containing Dennis, Na, and Rachel.
    Dennis: "I make cave."
    Lureene: "You work fast!"
She briefly explained the situation to them - the Yuan-ti won't interfere with us.

Na ran out and embraced his sister. "Is it over? Are we going home?"
Mwax: "Na, I'm so sorry I dragged you into this..."
    The genuine remorse earned her a point with Molly.

Lureene helped Na onto Creed's back; Dennis rode on Molly's.

As they left the palace complex, the guards at the south gate bowed to Molly.

## Streets of Omu

As soon as they were out of the palace, Rachel tried to book it. Molly caught her, though, and the party convinced her it was safer for her *not* to go off on her own. They then returned to Building #2: Base Camp.

## Base Camp

All the dead bodies were gone.
Orvex was hanging out by the fire and stood up when the party approached, incredibly surprised to see us.

The party briefly explained to him what had happened.
He was pretty shocked, said that made no sense.
    Re: the Hydra - they're *very* aquatic, what's it doing here? Is it someone's pet? Lureene guessed that maybe there's an underground waterway leading to the ocean.

Creed: "By the way, where'd the bodies go?"
Orvex: "As soon as you left last night, they got up and walked away. It was horrible, I was hiding... I didn't sleep a wink."
Lureene: "Oh geez I'm sorry. We should've dealt with that."

The compound at #2 *is* somewhat defensible, but the party opted to relocate their base to Bag of Nails' old place, as it's better-concealed and has a back exit.

## Base of Nails

Once there, Molly had the idea to put her insignia near the entrance, so that if the Yuan-ti do happen by they'll know not to fuck with it.
Since Orvex was a professional scribe, he made the insignia. It was flawless, of course.

Orvex asked to accompany the party to the shrines, just to observe. They saw no reason why not. (He was shocked to hear they'd acquired a cube from Ras Nsi as part of the betrothal deal, though.)

---

## Building 8 (Shrine of Unkh)

A walled courtyard with a small workshop off to one side. The walls inside the workshop are covered in hundreds and hundreds of iron keys.

Orvex reads the inscription on the door:
> "Unkh urges us to contrast all options before acting."
He adds that the priests of Unkh *were* contemplative, but often paralyzed by indecision.

the door had no keyhole.
Lureene and Karnassus looked around the outside of the building to see if there was another entrance, but there wasn't.
    Karnassus used Fly to hover over a puddle.
    Lureene: "I didn't know you could do *that!*"
    Karnassus: "Well I *am* a magic man."

so creed & molly opened the door. it came open effortlessly.

inside: a statue of a snail
in place of antennae it has 5 pseudopods ending in rocky clubs.
there are 6 plinths containing more iron keys.
behind the statue: a carved pedestal containing a cube, with a keyhole at its base.

Karnassus entered the shrine - and as he did, three Ghasts appeared out of nowhere!

### ROLL INITIATIVE.

* They ambushed him, and the magic effect of their attack paralyzed him!
* Lureene tried to drag him away, but couldn't get a grip on him, so she interposed herself between him and the ghasts. She has a good CON save fortunately.
* Creed approached and struck one down!
* Molly approached - and the ghasts bowed to her! Oh, they recognize her as their queen...
* So Lureene took the opportunity to whack them over the head with her mace, vaporizing them.

### COMBAT END.

Creed and Lureene improvise a fistbump plus starburst for owning the undead. Karnassus remains paralyzed - it's a sort of undead curse, apparently - but then Creed goes ahead and cures him of it.
Note: The one ghast remaining has Ras Nsi's brand on its tongues (so presumably all of them do).

Karnassus gathered up all the keys and overlaid them on each other... then went out to the workshop and found a single key configured like the overlaid keys, and used that. The pedestal corkscrewed up and opened a hatch containing the Cube of Unkh. Molly took the cube, and a second pedestal came up behind her, with a big red button. The doors slammed shut, and a booming voice resonated through the shrine - "TEN. NINE. EI-"

Molly slammed the red button, the countdown stopped, and the door opened.

### CLEAR!

# Next Time on Game Grumps

* Alatu wants to try opening the Necronomicon lookin' thing she got from [Voodoo Lady With Racist Name].
