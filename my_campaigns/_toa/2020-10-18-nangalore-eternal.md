*Continuing through the garden*

---

# It's still day 60

we got what we were after, but Creed (who was tripping balls on the local flora) wants to explore the rest of the gardens and purge them of the undead and stuff.

eridian realizes the statues are designed to attract nature spirits.
alatu ritual-casts comprehend languages again to check the inscription in a garden patch.
    "without dreams, eternity is unbearable."
and the next one north...
    "for the lies of the few, all must pay."

northwest: a crumbling pagoda.
some kind of animal is living there, blood oozing out of the building.
it's dark inside but we can see something in there...
but they seem to be asleep.

we attempt the stealthy approach, but we lead with the heavy-armor people,
so they trip over their dicks and wake up the birds.
it's a flock of Eblis! those evil talkative birds.
they try to invite us to lunch, but we're not falling for that shit.
Eridian opens with CALL LIGHTNING, and everyone charges in!
lureene crits, with a loud war cry!
    the birds start chattering in confusion.
alatu throws them food for some reason. no one notices.

anyway, we kill 3 of em and the other 3 fly away.
eridian senses something magical in here!
creed will go looking for it, sifting through piles of bird crap.

pouch: 7 gemstones (10g ea)
bracelet shaped like a coatl (50g) (lureene calls dibs cause it's cool looking.)
wooden scroll tube engraved with skeletons
    alatu opens it and finds a magic scroll inside!
    a scroll of protection from undead, in fact.


to the right: a pool of water, about 2 feet deep.
water birds are chilling on top of the water.
what used to be a statue, but now crumbled and fallen.
under the water: stone fish, turtles, lizards, and waterbirds.
were they turned to stone, or did they start out that way?
    eridian picks one up and can tell they're petrified.
creed plays hopscotch across rocks poking out of the water.
eridian and lureene, in the water, find two petrified humanoids as well


what can petrify? lureene tries to think back.
    medusas and gorgons.
    some dragons can do it with breath.
    various spells - flesh to stone.

lureene pulls herself up onto the balcony into the main palace.
once up she realizes "oh wait, this was reckless."
and secures a rope so the others can get up.

as eridian reaches the top, she hears HISSING.
    like snakes. that might be on someone's head.
moonbeam first, ask questions later!

lureene closes her eyes, thinking it's a medusa.
from the pool come two swarms of snakes!
oh, well at least it's not a medusa.

after much being buried in poisonous snakes,
they kill all the poisonous snakes.
lureene rips the last one off her, throws it to the ground and stomps on it.

since lureene's a bit worse for wear, we go ahead and take a break.
part of the ceiling collapses on Creed, but he's fine.
there's a 20ft deep pool, but nothing magic at the bottom.
there's another petrified person here, this one's a human.
there's a big statue of a dude with a spear.
    the face is intentionally ruined by deep gouges, but the rest of it is intact.


"True love, faithful general, you shall rest in Nangalore eternal. While I live, this is my vow (or something). For my sins, I cannot die."


they go back to zalkore.
eridian takes the place of the weird skull thing,
starts dancing with zalkore, and says "my love, i forgive you."
but zalkore is like "i know you aint him, but now you will dance with me foreverrr"
and won't let go of her.
molly tries to pull her off but gets swept up in the dance as well.
creed threatens the urn she's protective of, then breaks it.
    it's empty!
    the real urn is in the big statue room.
but, this distracts her from eridian and molly, makes her let them go.
she then goes back to dancing.

the party searches the room, giving her a wide berth.
creed finds 10 vials of "dreaming tincture," whatever that is.
they find a spell scroll: lesser restoration.

as they're getting ready to leave, lureene has a question.
she doesn't think the queen will be lucid enough to answer it,
but it's worth a shot.
"by the way, your highness, do you know how those people outside got all petrified?"

zalkore becomes enraged, rips off her veil, and screeches
    "HOW DARE YOU ASK THAT!"
turns out SHE'S the medusa! oh shit!

next time: roll initiative.
