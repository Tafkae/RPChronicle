# Day 70

Oh hey tonight's a full moon.

As we're heading toward building 3, we run into a pack of ghouls!
Led by a ghast, which is even stronger!!!
    Oddly, the ghast has a blue triangle tattooed on its forehead.

### *GHOUL x5, GHAST x1*

* Alatu casts Poison Spray! It does nothing.
* Lureene charges in and smacks the ghast twice with her Mace of Disruption, imploding his head in just two blows!!
  Oh hey maybe this thing's actually good! Especially against undead.
* Creed then draws his Holy Avenger, one-shots a first ghoul, then AoO's two more when they try to go after Karnassus. (Creed's the only one that got hit, but he resisted the poison or whatever.)
* Molly (who was worried she wouldn't even get a turn) kills the next one in two blows.
* Karnassus does Guiding Bolt and the last one falls.

Creed takes a minute to ritual cast Detect Poison and Disease.
Karnassus casts Augury. Would a peaceful approach to this frog dude have good results or bad? He meditates on his book and determines... *woe.* Yeah, no, you can't negotiate with the demon frog.

Karnassus seems to take a liking to Creed. As a Holy Avenger / destroyer of the undead, you are apparently his buddy.

## Building 3

A vine-draped shrine with a murky pool in front. The water's maybe 6-10 feet deep. Rotten former rope bridges are in there. A toppled monolith forms stepping stones to the center of the pool, where a statue of a large frog stands.

Karnassus sees some writing above the shrine gate, but can't make out what it says from here. He also notices some eye stalks in the pond and points them out. Oh, there's the froghemoth. Hey guys, maybe you should back away from the frog?
    Lureene's like "maybe we can distract it instead of fighting?"
    She knows froghemoths are beasts. Amphibious, susceptible to electricity.
    Known for eating prey whole.
    But Karnassus tells them his divination that peace wasn't going to work.
Lureene advises to back away from the pond, but Molly tries to negotiate with the froghemoth anyway. Predictably it doesn't work and she gets grappled by a tongue, though she manages not to be pulled into its hideous maw. ROLL INITIATIVE...

### *MINIBOSS: FROGHEMOTH x1*

* Molly makes a flying leap to try and land on the froghemoth! She lands all cool!
* Lureene tries to hop across the monolith, but it's slippery, so she falls in the water. It's only 6 feet deep where she is, so she's able to pull herself out easily.
* Creed teleports to the frog statue (look he has Misty Step now!), pockets the key, and hops effortlessly onto the froghemoth. Lureene is just pulling herself out as Creed teleports, and she's like, *"Seriously?!"*
* Orvex: "Uhh, I wouldn't stand on it if I were you, that'll make it easier for it to eat you!"
  Molly: *"It can fuckin' try!"*
* It fuckin' tries. The attempt is a rousing success, Molly is swallowed whole, and then so is Creed. But, thanks to Molly having Artus' dagger Bookmark, she can use Dimension Door as a bonus action! She and Creed teleport out of the monster's stomach... to back on top of the monster. She stabs with Bookmark but can't get through its hide.
* Lureene, feeling woefully inadequate, stays on the obelisk and just starts wailing on the damn thing with her mace.
* Alatu and Karnassus sling spells from the shore.
* Creed holds up his holy symbol and ABJURES the creature with Channel Divinity! "We will purify this place!" It didn't actually scare the thing but it did slow it down I guess.
* Alatu shoots a Goreball sailing over the creature's head... but where it lands, there's a CORPSE EXPLOSION. The Froghemoth takes a lot of damage and is displeased!
* Predictably, the Froghemoth eats Molly again (and downs her). It sticks out a tentacle and 

Above the door:
*"Kubazan urges us to tread without fear, and to give back as much as we take."*

As we thought, the key unlocks the door to the shrine. The doors are heavy but Creed & Lureene get them open.

on the far side of the room is the cube, as expected.
relief behind the cube: monstrous frog fighting a crane.
carved frog heads extrude from the walls above us.

the wooden beams, you could probably hop across those.
creed hops across, tries to hammer a piton into the wall. but it's not going in.
the others express that that might be against the spirit of the challenge?
    Creed: well if you guys wanna go, be my guest.
Karnassus nimbly hops across the beams

> *When evening came, a wily eblis stepped from his reed hut. He didn't like the Omuans, but without them he'd have no one to play his tricks on. The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.*

## Back on the Road

We return to the road and head north. A little ways up on the left, we find an abandoned campsite. There's a tattered yellow flag, 3 mouldering tents, and various torn-apart backpacks scattered about.

Molly and Lureene recognize the flag as belonging to the Company of the Yellow Banner.
    An adventuring party operating in the late 15th century DR, contemporary.
    They went on an adventure to Chult, where they found a ghost lantern containing the spirit of a Moon Elf warlock.
    After finding it, they had a quest to raise the warlock from the dead.
    But after embarking on that quest, they weren't heard from again...
The original quest was only like 6 months ago. Which means they weren't even known to be *missing,* they were just out. Well, I guess we found where they ended up.

Creed finds a moldy letter:

> Rue,
> 
> Devlin has a lead on the Eye of Zaltec! The old goat found an obelisk in the north that marks the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The Eye must be within, but the door is magically locked. We think the secret to opening it lies in the holy shrines.
> 
> We're headed into the ruins to check them out: Gods willing, we'll be back tonight. Ras Nsi's serpent people are on the prowl, so be careful. If you get into trouble, sound the swan horn twice and we'll come running.
> 
> For the Yellow Banner,
> Lord Brixton

Lureene realizes the Eye of Zaltec is not the lantern.
It's a legendary wondrous item, allows you to cast True Resurrection without materials or components.
Well, I guess that's what they were after...

Molly says we should take the flag so that the adventurers' families can know what happened to them.

## Building 10

Cracked pillars, surround a large flat-roofed ruin.
Reliefs on either side of the door, an almiraj charging at a zorbo.

> *I'jin teaches us to take the path least expected.*

Karnassus notices some extra writing that was obscured by moss, points it out to Orvex.

> *One morning, a wise zorbo emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince Ubtao of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn't be easy, so she asked a wily almiraj to help her. The almiraj snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and Ubtao spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, Obo'laka the zorbo and I'jin the almiraj became terrible enemies.*

Ah, it's exactly the same story as in Obo'laka's shrine.

Karnassus is ritual-casting Speak With Animals, but before he's done Molly goes up and Lureene helps her open the door.

### Entryway

A ten-foot-wide hallway with carvings of animals on the floor:
Almiraj, Dragonflies, Eagles, Giraffes, Monkeys, Tigers, Warthogs, and Zebras.

Orvex points out the "path least expected" thing.
I'jin taught her followers to live unpredictable lives, always changing paths.
Soooo, don't

Molly steps on the almiraj on the far left row. Each almiraj tile starts glowing with magic...
She chose the correct column *purely by coincidence,* apparently?
To be unpredictable, she jukes around a bit, but that means she doesn't have any at the final row that she hasn't stepped on. She steps on a duplicate (dragonfly) and gets hit with some kind of poison darts.

Creed runs straight down the leftmost path.
    Stepping on the bunny gets you 2d10 temp hp.

### Twisting Hallway

The entry lets out into a cramped hallway twisting in all directions.
Karnassus points out that this is a labyrinth, built by humans, designed to keep intruders away from something of worth. (He has the Archaeologist background.)
So it's a maze.

We set up some rope so we can find our way back. Molly leads the way.

Molly finds a dead end and steps on a pressure plate... but when she steps off it, a large axe swings from the ceiling!
She leaves a big X marked on the wall, as well as some helpful bloodstains.

After this, Karnassus starts checking for traps every few yards.

### Cube Room

A small room where a shaft of light illuminates I'jin's puzzle cube.
We take it and continue out the door on the opposite side of the room.

### Twisting Hallway

The hallway loops around. Just like a real labyrinth, it's impossible to get lost.

As we leave Building 10, Creed feels again like his pack's weight is ... *off.* But when he checks it, there's nothing unusual. It's packed with military precision. Weird!
