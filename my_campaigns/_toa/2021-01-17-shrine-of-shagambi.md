*Our heroes...*

The party returns from building 4 to the camp at building 2.
There's a bunch of wild dogs, but they drive them off by shooting an arrow and the dogs chasing it.

Short rest.
Karnassus heals Lureene.
Lureene asks if he's a cleric, but he says no, this is part of him being possessed/influenced by a being of Light. He's basically a reverse warlock.

Party returns to building 4, to see if the snake jaguars are still there.
    Creed notices his backpack is heavier... by one lizard kebab? Hm, it seemed like more weight than *that*...
They're still there, but now trying to stop us going *around* the structure.
Creed tosses half the lizard kebab in each direction,
    which distracts the cats long enough for them to force the door.

Inside are four statues and a pit with a cage over the top.
A conspicuously empty pedestal stands beyond the pit.
Relief behind the pedestal:
    a snake jaguar fighting off a Grung who's armed with a spear.
Writing underneath it: The story of Shagambi.
> At noon, a brave kamadan hopped down from her rock. She saw the evil in the Omuans' hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The kamadan fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty grung stole it. In her rage, Shagambi the kamadan forgot all about the Omuans and chased Nangnang the grung forever across the sky.

Kamadan: the cats with snakes.
Grung: humanoid frogs.

Molly finds a hatch on the pedestal, and trying to open it triggers a poison gas trap! Orvex fails his save - Lureene gives him an Antitoxin and Karnassus heals him.

Lureene goes down the stairs into a tunnel, which leads to the pit. Meanwhile, Creed ties a rope and rappels down.
As Creed hits the bottom, it activates several clay warriors!
Lureene enters thru the door, Molly jumps down, Karnassus slings spells from up top, Alatu does the same.
Creed gets his glaive disarmed, so he takes out the Holy Avenger!
    It doesn't help much, he goes down the next round.

It doesn't go well. Molly, Creed, and Lureene all go down, and Karnassus and Alatu are forced to retreat.
Suddenly, darkness swallows the area around the combatants. Some fighting noises are heard from within the darkness (by the conscious people).
Lureene nearly bleeds out, but Alatu stabilizes her -
    and then uses some Dream Tincture to make her disappear, i.e. be out of danger!


Anyway we take a few hours' rest.

Lureene's dream:
> She's aware of herself in a void... can't feel her body, can't see or hear anything... "Am I dead?" she thinks.
> Suddenly she sees something.
> A *face* lurking over her.
> She recognizes it as Mwaxanare.
> Tries to say her name, but nothing happens.
> Mwax looks at her, then in the black space...
> She sees the party members... Molly, Creed, and Alatu (not Eridian or Karnassus).
> 
> Mwax: "I loved her once... and now look what you made me do!"
> Hideous laughter, and the three party members fall screaming into the abyss.
> "NO!" she tries to yell, but nothing happens.
> 
> Mwax grows taller, and taller, as she stands, and takes up Lureene's entire field of view.
> Then it all turns white, she can't see anything else.
> 
> A tri-toned voice says: "we will build it, and it will draw all their souls to us." It belongs to a gray-blue, wrinkly face with a crown of bones...
> three hags step into your field of view.
> "it shall be, master." "we will make it."
> but the third hesitates. says "should any one being have such power?"
> the bone king stabs her with a scepter and she disappears.
> 
> then she's in a field of flowers.
> the bone king is hovering over you.
> he feels like he's reaching into your chest, but you have no chest.
> the flowers around you start to wither, as fine wisps of smoke come out of them and are drawn into your body...

and then you wake up.

Lureene wakes up and she's just... fine!
    Apparently Dream Tincture gives the effects of a long rest!
    But we don't have *concrete* proof of that besides Lureene, so.
    And Molly doesn't want to use it without the proper ritual framework so they can interpret the dreams. I guess.
Creed's been given a healing potion, and he used Lay on Hands on Molly.

The mystery combatant turned out to be Dennis, apparently?!
But he's just rocking back and forth all "I want to live" over and over and seems kind of traumatized by the whole affair.
(Lureene gives him a hug, but it doesn't seem to help.)

We put the spears in the statues' hands, and get the Shagambi Cube! hooray.

Lureene checks the place where the clay warriors came from. She finds clay warriors (without spears).

We spend the night in the shrine, since the heavy stone door is pretty secure.
We hear clawing on the doors overnight, but nothing gets in.
Karnassus senses something watching the party during the night, but it doens't show itself.
