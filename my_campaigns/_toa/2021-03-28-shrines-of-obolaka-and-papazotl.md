*Our heroes identify a disgusting book*

# Day 71 (cont'd)

## Mid-Afternoon

The party discussed what to do with the book (it was Molly's idea, because of course it was).
The idea is maybe there's some necromantic magic Alatu can harness to turn Ras Nsi's army of undead against him.
Karnassus communes with his warlock patron and gets the sense that opening this book would be a *real* bad idea.
Still, Creed gets out his Holy Avenger, and Lureene casts Protection from Evil and Good on Alatu, and Alatu tentatively gives it a try.

She sets the book on the ground and unwraps it with a stick. (It burned her last time she touched it, I guess.)
    It's leather-bound, but the leather doesn't seem all the way cured, so... gross.
    It's kinda sticky and stringy.
Karnassus uses Sense Magic; the aura is Transmutation, Conjuration, and Enchantment.

Alatu opens the book with a stick... nothing happens immediately.
So, she proceeds to lean over and read it.
    As she begins reading, she sees blood drip down onto the page... from her nose.
    Then she passes out.
    (She could not read it at all.)

Karnassus casts Cure Wounds on her, she wakes up with a killer headache.

Orvex comes in and says he could sense we were doing something big in here.
We debate for a while whether to let him look at it, then decide "okay okay sure whatever he's the expert."

He unwraps it with a stick and recognizes it instantly:
It's a **Manual for Flesh Golems**. "I won't be opening that."
    It contains information and magic for creating a flesh golem.
    Most golem manuals aren't as evil as this, but flesh golems require sacrifice, so it's inherently an evil book.
Orvex isn't sure how it's *used*. It's rumored the flesh for this golem has to be stripped from a living creature... flayed alive over 60 days, or some shit.
Buuut, it *is* worth a lot of money on the black market. Like 60000 gp.
    "Oh hey well if we can't use it, then I might as well hold onto it," Molly takes and wraps it up and stuffs it in her pack.

## The Box o' Nails

The party returns to their hideout at Bag of Nails' place for a long rest.
Creed tries to fish but doesn't get anything.
Alatu forages and gets enough for everybody.

There isn't any trouble overnight.

# Day 72

## The Box o' Nails, Morning

Although, Mwax seems to be taking charge again... She's had Rachel and Na put up a curtain, they've cleaned up behind it...
Molly and Alatu call her out and give her a talking-to.
    "Are you at least *contributing*, young lady?"
    Mwax: "I made dinner while you all were out!!"
    Molly and Alatu impress upon her that she needs to change her ways at home as well, and that if *she* wants comfort, the people with her also want comfort.
    Mwax: "Ugh, fine." (She tears down the curtain and sets them )

There's some debate over whether Mwax should really be left in charge...
    Creed's kind of staying out of it.
    Lureene tries to suggest to Mwax that if she and Na worked as equals, they could be really great as a team.
    Mwax tunes them out halfway through.
Ultimately we decide to let the three stay there but leave Orvex with them, in charge.

1. There's a secret key in the painting that you can use to get into the front passageway.
2. The pools are easy - step in one, come out the other.
3. How do you disarm the trap on the cube?
   Anyone that touches the cube becomes petrified. It's a magical trap.
   But there's a puzzle: "Staying in the light." ("Tread warily" means treading water.)

Mwax: "I'll try to do better, but this place is *getting* to me. How long until we can go home??"
Molly reassures her, tells her we're doing our best.
Mwax: "I can hear the city crying out to me. There's all these voices in my head, all the time! I'm worried I might do something to Na..."
    Molly: "Well, try writing them down, and maybe that'll soothe them?"
    Mwax hesitantly nods and agrees to try.
Also, if she feels overwhelmed, she should isolate herself to protect the others.
    She doesn't have to stay by herself all day - only if she needs it.
Mwax agrees to this so we can finally get fuckin going.

## Building 19: Shrine of Obo'Laka

A pair of needlelike columns are near the entrance of the wall.
This temple is in pretty good shape compared to others.

"Obo'laka teaches us to tread warily and stay in the light."

We left the secret door open last time. Lureene and Karnassus take the front way, everybody else takes the back way.
    As before, there are a bunch of paintings:
    Lined with paintings of people hunting, harvesting fruit, planting crops, crafting weapons, feasting, fighting, weaving, and skinning animals.
    There are 8 torch sconces, with the burned-out torches that we put there last time.
    (The torches didn't seem to do anything last time, so Lureene doesn't worry about lighting them right now.)
Then they reach the sun pool. Lureene walks right in, and Karnassus checks the magic on it before walking in as well. The party regroups in the moonpool room.


The final room:
Lit torches line the walls. (They're clearly magical, if they haven't burned out after all this time...)
A petrified dude is still standing there with his hand on the cube.
Karnassus tries to Prestidigitate the torches out and grab the cube! He succeeds his CON save, but it doesn't move.
Then Lureene has the idea to move the magic torches to the hallway sconces. They take them out via the secret passage, since, you know, you don't wanna go through a *water* portal when you're trying to move a *flame*...
As they put the torches where they belong, there's a grinding noise, and when we come back the cube has rotated 45 degrees. Molly pokes it with her scimitar again and it falls right off the pedestal.

**CUBE GET!**

## Back at Camp

The party returns to camp to consult with Orvex.

* Wongo's shrine was #12, we got that cube from Ras Nsi, so we can skip that.
* Neng-neng's shrine is #18; the red wizards have that one, so we'll have to find them instead. A few had escaped alive; we didn't find the cube around the dead bodies.
* Papazotl's flooded shrine (#16) is the only one left. Orvex says there's crocodiles everywhere, the wizards couldn't get in.

Orvex draws something for us. (Molly: "It's a puppy!" Orvex draws her a puppy, then draws the actual thing.)
He draws a portrait of Valindra Shadowmantle, in case we happen to run into them.
She's the leader of the Red Wizards.
    Let her know that we got Orvex out of the rubble and have been working with him. It should help to frame it as "that means you owe us."

## Point 11: Overturned Cart

There's an overturned cart that seems to have been here a while - there's a bees' nest in one of the wheels now. But oddly, there's fresh flowers on the 

A moss-covered stone disc with concentric inscriptions. Molly grabs it and looks it over. One inscription is in Common, the others are in various types of cuneiform (like Omuan and other ancient languages).
> "Queen Napaka proclaims that the free people of Omu fear nothing. Brave new gods protect us, as Ubtao did before but does no longer. Omu will rise again, and Napaka shall reclaim all that is hers by right of conquest."

Karnassus realizes the tablet is kind of a Rosetta Stone! He could translate stuff into the other languages with it, given time.

## Point 15: Derelict Bazaar

The ruins of a market.
The party searches the ruins, but finds nothing - the market's been picked clean.
Except Karnassus finds hidden stairs leading into a cellar.
At the bottom of the stairs, there's been a lot of foot traffic, but they're trying to conceal themselves. Lureene recognizes them as kobold footprints. Molly knows a little about kobolds, as she gets mistaken for them often.
    They're tunnelers, live underground (because they're sensitive to sunlight), some have wings. Quite magical, generally worship evil dragons.
So, that's something to keep an eye out for after dark...

## Building 16: Shrine of Papazotl

### Exterior

The shrine sits within the floodplain of the river, so there's water about waist-high.
Creed attempts to use his crocodile-skin duster to disguise himself as a gator!
    It... doesn't really work.
The crocodiles are hanging out by the front gate of the temple, so we wade out.

There's a *dead* crocodile floating in the water nearby.
But Karnassus notices three dead humanoids floating in the water, all in red.
Creed notices more crocodiles in the water.

Creed and Molly set about searching the bodies, while Lureene keeps an eye on the gators. They don't have anything useful, it's all waterlogged.
The second corpse is Valindra Shadowmantle. But she doesn't seem to have the cube...
    Karnassus notices (with his magic-vision) that there's some kind of Illusion spell on that corpse though.
    So... this may not actually *be* Valindra.
They were definitely killed *by* the crocodiles. Maybe the cube ended up in one of their stomachs?
    But Karnassus' magic-vision says no, there's nothing magical in or around them.

Well, let's kill them anyway. This is easy.
    Karnassus one-shots the only one Lureene was close enough to hit, so she's a little miffed about that.
    Creed easily kills the other two.

Creed checks the third body. It is also dead, but bloated and leaking some kind of substance into the water. The corpse kind of disintegrates as he messes with it. You find nothing useful.
Karnassus cleans the corpse juice off him with magic.

### The Shrine

Decorated with carvings of the eblis (those asshole birds).
Carving above the door... Alatu casts Comprehend Languages and reads it.
    "Papazotl teaches us to bow before no one."

Lureene opens the door all by herself! How impressive.
Behind it is... a small mossy room.
In the floor, a mosaic we've seen before, of an eblis fighting a froghemoth.

The next door is ajar. Lureene peers inside, but sees absolutely nobody.

### Inner Sanctum

6 Statues face inward from alcoves along the walls.
bare-chested humans with the heads of different animals.
    lizard, jaguar, lobster, toucan, bat, frog.

around the base of the shrine, lureene notices some ancient omuan writing.
Alatu reads it and recognizes it as the story of Kubazan and Papazotl.
As you recall:
> When evening came, a wily eblis stepped from his reed hut. He didn't like the Omuans, but without them he'd have no one to play his tricks on. The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.

On top of the pedestal is writing - in Common:

> Comes with sunshine
> Leaves with night
> Hides in darkness
> Does not bite
> Always joined to its caster
> Never strays from its master

Uh... that's a shadow, right?
Lureene holds up her glowy mace to cast the shadow of her hand on the pedestal. Nothing happens.

Molly bows to each statue in turn. Nothing happens.
Lureene follows her around with the light source.
Behind the Bat statue, as they cast her shadow on it: they notice a secret passage!
Etched on the wall is a 15x7 grid - with a few of the squares filled in.

It sounds wheel of fortune-ey...
Do we just write in the riddle into the grid?

```
COMESWITHDARKNE
SSLEAVESWITHNIG
HTHIDESINDARKNE
SSDOESNOTBITEAL
WAYSJOINEDTOITS
CASTERNEVERSTRA
YSFROMITSMASTER

COVER EYES
```

Oh okay! So back in the main room, we cover all the statues eyes, and Karnassus bows to the pedestal with nobody watching.
The hatch opens and the cube is dispensed.

It is now about 3 pm.

## Outside

Karnassus examines "Valindra's" corpse more closely... and realizes that the image doesn't line up with what he can actually feel. So this *isn't* Valindra after all.

On the way out, Molly steps on something sharp and faceplants in the water!
She picks it up... it's the Neng-Neng puzzle cube! Appears to be the genuine article.
Convenient, but there we go!

# Next Time on Game Grumps

We'll reconvene in 2 weeks (after Easter). Then I guess we'll go back to base camp, chat with Orvex (he wanted to come to the tomb, right?), and then enter the Tomb and die instantly. :p
