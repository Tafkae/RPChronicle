*Investigating the chariot room*

---
 
## Chariot Room

6 glass cauldrons brimming with humanoid bones along the east & west walls.
ancient chariot bearing a bronze sarcophagus with tons of treasure strewn atop it.
    gold coins, statues, jeweled weapons, etc.
paintings on the chariot show an eblis.
on the wall behind the chariot is a tall bronze shield with image of a chultan warrior carrying a spear.
    inscription beneath the shield:
    "BOW BEFORE NO ONE."
4 bronze statues along south wall, chultan warriors:
sword, spear, spear, fourth is missing its face.

There's another skeleton: this one's jaw is a square.

Molly heard a voice in her head, and immediately started shoveling treasure into her pack.
    Creed recognized that this is pretty reckless even for her.
In response, a bunch of skeletons rose out of the cauldrons!

- Lureene moved up, putting her back against the chariot, and readied an attack against any undead that comes within range.
- Karnassus noticed the cauldrons all had Conjuration auras. Well, that tracks. He joined Lureene and shot an Eldritch Blast at the skeletons.
- Creed asked Molly if she wanted him to cast a helpful spell on her? She was like yeah sure whatever. So he ran up and cast "Protection from Evil and Good" on her.  
  >  *If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.*
  Then he engaged some skeletons in combat.
- A bunch of skeletons converged on the chariot. Lureene vaporized one, but rolled like shit on her 2nd attack and got her mace caught on the sarcophagus. (Disadvantage next turn)
- Molly got swarmed by pretty much all the remaining skeletons.
- Molly retaliated with her cold breath on three of them. Two froze and shattered.
  She tried to hit another one with her hammer but missed.
- The chultan warrior *embossed on the shield* suddenly moved! It threw a spear at Karnassus, which stuck him right in the leg.
- Lureene got her mace free and whiffs her first attack but then vaporizes another skelly.
- Karnassus has a spear sticking out of his leg, so his movement is halved. Until, of course, he heals himself and the spear pops right out. Then he healed Molly some too.
  Then he ran over and bowed before the statue without a face.
- Creed noticed *lizards* crawling out of Molly's Alatu-flesh-bag and falling onto the floor before skittering away. *HMM*. He brought this to her attention.
  One was an iguana, but the others are some other species.
  He picked up an iguana and puts it on his shoulder. It seemed confused, but not hostile.
- The remaining skeletons broke off hostilities, returning to their cauldrons. Creed caught a couple of 'em with his glaive as they left.
- Molly took a peek in the Alatu bag, and a frog tried to pop up through the hole.
  She waited for a second to see if it would talk, but when it didn't, she closed the bag back up. (Logic: Something's happening and I better take responsibility! Alatu's not done yet, needs a little more time in the oven.)
- The shield threw another spear, which lodged itself in Lureene's shoulder!
- So Lureene pulled it out and threw it back!! It hit the shield, but bounced off without any damage. (I don't know what I expected.)
- Karnassus walked up and took the shield off the wall. It was heavy, but he otherwise encountered no resistance. He then laid it facedown on the floor.
  There was nothing interesting on the back.
  He tossed a heal onto Lureene.
- Creed dispatched the last skeleton.
  He picked up the two fence lizards.
- Molly was trying to hold the bag closed, and ribbiting could be heard from inside it.
  Suddenly, it seemed like there was something much *bigger* inside, wriggling against the side of the bag.
  Lureene offered to catch anything that escaped the bag while they shoved the lizards back in.
- Molly opened the bag and three frogs and an eagle leapt out!
  Lureene managed to catch the eagle! She managed to Animal Handle it, pinning it to her body so it couldn't escape. It was still pretty pissed, but it couldn't 
- Then the bag got ripped open as a giant crocodile *and a triceratops* fell out onto Molly.
    The bag is still recognizable as a bag but it's pretty worse for wear.
- The triceratops tried to get out of the way, though there wasn't much room.
- The croc was pretty pissed, hissing at Molly as it tried to right itself!
Molly punched it in the snout to establish dominance.
It backed up, not pinning Molly anymore.
- To Karnassus's magic sense, the *animals* didn't seem magical, but the bag still had a bunch of Acererak magic weirdness going on.
- The triceratops found its footing and fuckin *stomped* on the giant crocodile!
- Molly opened the bag again to look inside and saw a human hand reaching out of the bag.
  Molly: "Alatu??"
- Lureene, deeply confused, just focused on staying out of the way and calming her new eagle friend. The eagle started calming down a bit, though it still wasn't happy.
- Karnassus: "Were we expecting those guys?"
  Creed: "Nope, this was very much not part of the plan!"
  Karnassus then shot the croc with a Guiding Bolt.
- Predictably, the crocodile immediately went after Karnassus, knocking the chariot out of the way. Karnassus hid between the cauldrons to evade its teeth, but the cauldrons started responding again... (and the croc was in the way of the faceless statue, so how do we turn it off?)
- Creed moved up to assist, attacking the croc.
- Alatu's face appeared in the bag! (She appeared to be a girl!)
  Molly carefully set the bag down to let Alatu crawl out, then readied to defend her from any hostile creatures.
- The triceratops attacked Molly!
- Lureene, seeing the Alatu arms crawling out of the bag, released the eagle and rushed over to help her. Moving the bag aside, she saw Alatu's face. "Oh my god..."
  How was this possible? Was this really happening?? She didn't know, but for now she's going to help her friend.
  She offered her hand to help Alatu pull herself out.
- Karnassus killed the croc, and rapidly bowed before the statue, causing the skeletons to back off again.
- Creed ran over to help with the triceratops, flanking it and hitting it in the butt.
- Lureene realized all of a sudden... *this is the **same triceratops*** that they encountered in the Yuan-Ti citadel!
  Lureene, confused, was like - "It's the same one...?"
- Alatu pulled herself out of the bag, fully naked (and female), but apparently alive.
- The triceratops tried to gore Creed, with great success! It went like right through his chest, but he was still up, somehow.
- Molly attacked but didn't really land it.
- Lureene scrambled onto the chariot and started wailing on the triceratops as well, with great success. She broke off one of its horns, actually.
  Since this disturbed the sarcophagus again, the skeletons reactivated (*again*).
- Karnassus tossed a heal onto Creed and then bowed before the statue again, resetting the skeletons.
- Creed attacked the triceratops for great justice. This killed the triceratops.


A tearful reunion with Alatu happened.
Apparently the other animals were all from bones she'd collected.
Alatu: "Took y'all long enough."

Nobody knew how this was possible, including Alatu, but it really did seem to be her.
Creed gave her his shirt for modesty's sake. It was way too big on her.

Molly retrieved the bag.
Alatu retrieved her skeleton friend, who was tied to Molly this whole time, and twisted off a finger bone. They wrapped it up in the remains of the bag to see what would happen.

Lureene called Orvex in. He was deeply surprised by all the shit that happened in here, but sat down and started documenting the room.
Alatu: "It'd go faster with two of you. Wanna sacrifice a finger!"
Lureene: "*Alatu!*" (But, yeah, it's really her.)

Creed went over to Karnassus and spoke to him briefly in a lowered voice.
Creed expressed concern about Alatu, saying the resurrection bag smelled *really* evil to him, and Alatu smelled a little "off" too.
Karnassus posited that she must have been brought back by magic, not a real resurrection.
Creed and Karnassus agreed to keep tabs on her behavior, keep an eye out in case she did anything weird or wrong.
    (He approached Karnassus because he's the least attached to Alatu.)
Karnassus asked: "Should I just notify you, or take action?"
    Creed told him to use his best judgment, but not *hesitate* to take action if she was going to cause imminent obvious danger to the party.

Karnassus warned that there was something else magic inside the sarcophagus.
Lureene opened the sarcophagus.
    It wasn't too hard to open for her.
Inside were the brittle bones of an eblis, and a gold torque (250 gold), 3 gold cups (75g each), 5 gold cloak pins (25g each), and a red amulet that looks magic (Amulet of Health).

Lureene cautiously picked up the amulet.
At that moment, the shadow of an eblis flitted around the room and attacked Lureene!
She heard a voice in her head - *"You will do as I say!!"*
    Lureene: "*Nnnnno!*"
    She felt something trying to enter her mind, but successfully resisted it.

Creed got up and was like, "Oh, uh, hey, I was gonna warn you there's soemthing magical, but I guess you found it."
Lureene went ahead and put it on.

Lureene offered Alatu the triceratops horn - it's pretty sharp, and also it's a piece of a dead thing, so she figured she'd enjoy that.
Alatu happily accepted it, as she had no weapons right now.
Creed offered some daggers around to Alatu and others, since he had like 8 of them.

They cornered the new skeleton friend and took his hand, tying him to Molly.
    (Molly refused to share the skeleton friends.)

They wanted to investigate the shield a little further, so Lureene took it, keeping it facing the ground. It stabbed the fuck out of her foot, so she kept it pressed to the wall and walked the circumference of the room.
When she got out of the door, the shield vanished from her arm and reappeared on the wall, where it threw a spear at Molly.
Molly kicked the shield, trying to knock it off the wall, but it... firmly stayed in place.
She then went to pick it up... and it was *stuck* to the wall. And threw another spear at her, missing at point-blank range.

Soooo, everybody ran the fuck out of the room.
The shield critted on Orvex, but he didn't go down, thank goodness.
The shield did not throw anything at Karnassus as *he* ran out...
    so he reentered, bowed to the statue, and tried to take the shield off the wall.
    He was able to do so without resistance.
    He tried to take the shield out of the room, and it just disappeared and went back to the wall. SHRUG.

All the treasure from on top of Papazotl's sarcophagus also disappeared when it entered a bag or left the room, incidentally. But the stuff from inside persisted.

## Wine Hallway

The party decided to take a short rest in the wine hallway.
    (It's just as cramped as doing so on the landing, but more defensible.)

# Next time on Game Grumps

- I dunno, do we go downstairs???
- Maybe we should collect the other shape-jaw skeletons?
