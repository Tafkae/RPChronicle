(Compromise: it took us ONE hour to travel there.)

While the party whisper-discusses what to do about Bag of Nails, the tabaxi tries to sneak out the back door.

We go down the tunnel he was trying to escape down... it's a 5-foot tunnel leading outside.
When we come back in to rest, we find Bag of Nails definitely untied... and dead in the corner of Midnight Tears poison.
Whoops.

What to do about the body? Given that we're in a haven of the undead, we should probably cremate him.
Or toss him in the volcano.
    What? No, that's terrible!
    But we're gonna do it anyway.
In the morning, though.
We compromise by locking the corpse in a closet overnight.


# Day 68

We go and toss Bag of Nails in the lava.
    Along with his magic sword I guess.

Then some vegepygmies toss a frog dude into the lava so we kill them in retaliation. (Being a dick cannot be tolerated!)

Then we use our last day of flight to fly across to the big island in the lava. It's overgrown with palm trees in front of a little squat building.
    The pillars have reliefs of coiled serpents.

On a hunch, Creed ritual-casts "Detect Poison and Disease."
It turns out to be a very good hunch, as there are 4 Jaculi hiding in the bushes!
    Jaculi: big poison snek.
They're jobbers, though. Lureene tries out the new longbow and crits an arrow right through the eye on one of them, surprising even herself.

An inscription on the door
    "Moa teaches us that secrets hide the truth."
"Moa" sounds familiar to Molly. It's one of the nine gods of Omu.

Inside the building is crumbling.
Inscriptions of serpents everywhere.
Arrow slits every 5 feet, filled with cobwebs.
    This is clearly a trap, there's probably pressure plates.
    Molly throws her heavy crossbow over Creed's head.
Eridian inspects it and finds pit traps actually.
THen we remember we can fly so we just fly over the pits.

Next room: A bunch of warrior statues pointing crossbows at a nondescript cube on the table.

> On the mosaic:
> Death rewards a thief deceived.
> Truth comes from the serpent's mouth.
> 
> Around the pedestal:
> That night, a su-monster broke into Ubtao's palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the su-monster hid the pail in a jaculi's burrow. Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the su-monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the jaculi and eat him up.

solution:
Take the cube from the secret room on the right.
the other two are illusory and disappear when you leave the ruins.

next: let's find mwax and na.
where would they go? palace, probably. (#20)

so we'll hit up #19 & #20.



building 19:
a stone house, with carvings of angry bears on the doors.
4 weird ugly bears patrolling the grounds. (zorbo)
they are Small with hairless bellies.
    zorbos: ferocious omnivores the size of a koala.
    they are animals, not sapient.

Eridian convinces one to go steal food from the others.

### corridor 1

Lined with paintings of people hunting, harvesting fruit, planting crops, crafting weapons, feasting, fighting, weaving, and skinning animals.

We found 8 empty torch holders and put lit torches in them! ... Nothing happened.

### big room

mosaic of 
zorbo vs almiraj.

> One morning, a wise zorbo emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince Ubtao of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn't be easy, so she asked a wily almiraj to help her. The almiraj snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and Ubtao spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, Obo'laka the zorbo and I'jin the almiraj became terrible enemies.

A stone cube has the 
a petrified person has their hand on the cube in this room.
