## Day 43

rations: yes (7 remain)
bugspray: yes (70 remain)

we reach m'bala around lunchtime.
eridian tells azaka that nanny pu'pu is a hag and we're gonna deal with her.
    the oracle told us she ate her entire village!

we hear a child crying from the well.
suddenly a bunch of flying monkeys descend!
and also a zambo appears!
    legs & arms of a big orc, but chest is skinny human and it has a baby head.

lureene hears whispers talking about her insecurities.
    "you just couldn't impress your parents, could you?
    no matter what you do.
    you'll always be the shame of the family."
"who said that?! show yourself!" she exclaims.
    2d4 psychic damage.

the monkeys don't attack so we don't attack them.
but attacking the big guy....
    it doesn't leave a scratch!
        so either he's got fuckin 12 DR or we're missing something here.
a lighting storm doesn't work even!
    it seems to make him even stronger!## Day 43

is it a frankenstein??
an illusion?

molly grapples it.



it was a flesh construct and it just about fucked us all up.
terrible work!
but we managed to keep granny from escaping and killed her.

she took dennis hostage and lureene almost killed him on accident.

lureene apologized to him afterwards.


following the evil aura in the well,
somebody found
- an evil book bound in skin (alatu took this)
- a waterproof bag with:
  - a few spell scrolls we couldn't identify
  - 10 adamantine ingots stamped with dwarven runes
    - creed gets 5, lureene gets 5
  - 6 onyx gemstones
