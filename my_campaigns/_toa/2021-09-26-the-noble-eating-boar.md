*Lureene finds a secret staircase and Molly gets decapitated*

-----

# Day 76, 4 pm

## Kubazan's Tomb

The party took a short rest. Creed recalled that using Dream Tincture in the serpent fortress didn't actually *heal* him, just made him Exhausted, so they decided not to use that.

They decided to try the secret door Orvex accidentally found on the south side of the hallway, with Lureene leading the way with renewed confidence.

## Golden Skull Room

Behind the secret door was a small room, with a short staircase leading down to a gold skull on a pedestal.

Eridian cast Detect Magic, and reported the skull was *magic as fuuuuck.*
Lureene decided to put the blue and purple crystal eyeballs into its eye sockets.

of course you wouldn't know
i can tell you my name
yaka
try me.

you gonna put an eyeball in the mouth?
Lureene: You gonna tell me what it'll do? Is that gonna kill us?
Yaka: It won't *kill* you... You think I'd kill you, here, in this tomb?
Everyone: Yeah, literally everything else here has tried.
Yaka: "Okay, *fair*, but..."
Lureene: "So what'll happen if we give you that?"
Yaka: "Someone of your meager intellect wouldn't understand?"

Orvex recognized the name "Yaka" - way back in Omuan history, there was an entertainer employed by the royal family. But he disappeared.

Everyone else was underwhelmed.
Lureene: "An entertainer? That's not an intellectual trade, a monkey can be an entertainer."
Yaka: "Not as entertaining as me."
Lureene: "Where's Melvin, we can have a contest."

Molly plucked the skull out of the air and stuffed it in a bag for time-out. (After )h

it teleported back to lureene

## Crawlspace

no traps in here. leads to a tiny room.

## Tiny Room

just a lever, a door to the north, and a tomb guardian. And a weird tinted window to the south.

the tomb guardian stood to attention as if it heard something -
    but it was looking WEST, not east toward them.
then it looked around almost as if nervous.

It looked intently out the window 

- Lureene got the first move, and lands two solid hits!
- Molly, hearing the sound of a mace on plate armor, entered the crawlspace to join the fight. (She did alert the others to the fight, though.)
- Eridian shoved past Yaka to follow Lureene into the room, though there wasn't really room to *leave* the crawlspace unless she transformed... So she did, into a Clawfoot Raptor.
- Creed *(unsure how much help he'll be in a 3-foot tunnel)*: "Do you guys need me down there?"
  Lureene: "Nah, it's just a Tomb Guardian! I got this!"
- The Tomb Guardian punched Eridian and Lureene at the same time.
- Alatu entered the crawlspace.
- Orvex waited in the doorway. "That's why you don't crawl into strange holes, especially in this tomb!"
- Lureene landed one solid hit and one glancing.
- Molly backed out of the tunnel into the skull room.
- Eridian lashed out with her claws! It did nothing.
- The Tomb Guardian, deciding Eridian wasn't a threat, turned its attention solely on Lureene. Missed one, but critted on the second.
- Lureene used her Second Wind and continued laying into him!
- Eridian turned back to her elf form, cast Shillelagh on her staff, and whacked the fuck out of the Guardian! It looked like it was about to fall over, then stood up and *howled...*
- Its energy renewed, the Tomb Guardian attacked Eridian and Lureene both twice! Ouch.
  It seems they have an Enrage at low HP.
- Hearing the howl, Alatu lit a torch and entered the tunnel.
- Lureene summoned up all her Action Surge energy and laid into it with all she had! Four hits, two of them solid, and the damn thing finally fell.

Eridian dodged it and healed Lureene up.

Behind the window - black-tinted glass - was a weird cone-shaped room, opening into a larger room below. But it was impossible to see very far beyond the lip of the cone.

Lureene tried the door to the north, and found it led to a **spiral staircase**. It was well-lit and led both up and down. Eridian recognized it as a place she'd found on the way in - it was behind a secret door behind *another* secret door. But she'd heard a bunch of voices, and they weren't ours, so she hadn't gone that way.

Voices, huh? Lureene listened closely, and with a nat 20 on Perception, she *oh-so-faintly* heard the sound of snoring coming from upstairs.

Lureene *(whispering)*: "I hear snoring, I'm gonna check it out!"
With that, she entered the staircase and began stealthily ascending.
Eridian: "Do you want me to come with, or...?"
Lureene: "Yeah, just keep it quiet."

So Lureene, Eridian, and Alatu stealthed up the stairs. Alatu failed the Stealth check though.

## 2F, hallway


"That stupid adventurer party is here! They've found our stairs! Get the guardians!"
Lureene asked Eridian to heal her up real quick, and advanced on the western door.

Suddenly, Eridian heard a cry of anguish from somewhere below them. She recognized the voice - it was Creed...

**TO BE CONTINUED**

## Tapestry room

Meanwhile, hearing Lureene say the coast was clear, Creed and Molly decided to check out the tapestry room. The tapestry showed a scene of merriment, nobles sitting around a table eating and making merry.

Creed recommended looking past the tapestry with a mirror, so Molly did. Five feet behind it was another embroidered curtain!

Molly pushed the curtain northward...

The next curtain was a scene of wild depravity. The nobles were fighting and vomiting and fucking on the table and sprawled all over the place...

Molly tried with the mirror (Creed reminded her to) and beyond it: another tapestry!

The third was a scene of absolute horror. Nobles were feasting on servants, eating each other alive, the roast boar was alive and laughing, the apple falling out of its mouth, the place was on fire...
    A weaker person might have fled in terror! But not these two.

Creed suggested he close his eyes before Molly opens the next one. "Just tell me if everything's okay or if it's not."
Molly tried the mirror, but didn't see a creature *or* a tapestry. It looked like something was mounted on the wall...
    (*Breanna: Oh, that's somehow worse.*)

Flesh blood and gore spatters on its tusks, dribbling from its mouth onto the floor.
Molly: "I think the boar won the party. It's kinda gnarly..."
    Then her voice went oddly *flat* suddenly.
    "Everything's fine."
    She began walking toward the boar's head.
    (*Breanna: Oh, am I getting mind-controlled by a pig **and** a frog? It's like the Muppet Show in my brain.*)

Creed immediately realized something was fucky! ROLL INITIATIVE.
He tried to shield his eyes so he wasn't looking at the boar's head, but opened his eyes to see Molly. This worked!
He cast Hold Person on Molly. But because of Creed's aura and the Holy Avenger, she had advantage on the save!
    And then her first roll was a nat 1, but her second was a nat 20.
Molly was well and truly hypnotized. "It's fine."
    She inserted her head into the boar's mouth, and the boar bit down...
    LUCKILY this wasn't an insta-kill trap, it just did damage.
    But that didn't break the hypnosis, and it kept chewing on her.

Creed tried to pull her back, but its grip was too strong!
Unsure what to do, Creed started whaling on the boar's head with the Holy Avenger.
He got in two good hits, but it wasn't enough.
As the boar bit down a third time, Molly's body fell away... without her head.

Creed was stunned for a second, then attacked the boar's head, eyes closed, with everything he had - and he heard somethign cracking, and crumbling, and falling.
He added Divine Smite, but there was nowhere for it to go...

He cautiously opened his eyes, and discovered he had utterly destroyed the boar's head. Behind it was a hole in the wall, containing an assortment of items... and Molly's head.

Creed was devastated. Molly was his closest friend, the one he'd known best *before* all this. He lifted her head from the hole, placed it next to her body, and pulled the happiest of the three tapestries from its place, draping it over her body.
Then he sat still, reflecting somberly on his experiences with Molly...
And he let out a loud howl of grief and anguish, renewing his oath of Vengeance, and adding Molly's name to the list of those he must avenge.

Then he went and ritual-cast Gentle Repose on her body. He's planning to burn her body and the tapestry, though he had the presence of mind to salvage her effects. (Except he remmebered she wanted to be burned with her silk pajamas.)

# Next time on Game Grumps

- Breanna rolls a new character probably.

# Last thoughts from Breanna

> *I love the idea that Molly died by the Noble Eating Boar. Like, she woulda felt that to be fitting. Of course the only thing that can kill her is the thing that ate a room full of rich people*
