*Our heroes are captured by the forces of Ras Nsi; a proposal is made; a short rest, taken; a grievous betrayal, uncovered.*

---

Molly, being surrounded: "Hey, we got no beef with you! We're just here for the brat."
Alatu: "Yeah don't move! If we're harmed, your future queen will die! Be smart, we don't want trouble!"

The humanoid (Sekelok) is unintimidated, and doesn't seem to care about Molly having hit him.

* Lureene puts her tortoise shield on and calls for Creed (he hears her!), then *tries* to channel a Thunderwave spell through the shield for extra damage. The shield doesn't amplify the spell, it turns out, but it *does* push some of the yuan-ti back, creating an opening for Molly and co.!
* ... Which ... they don't have time to take advantage of, because the yuan-ti go before them in initiative.
* Karnassus is still in the harem and hasn't been spotted. He casts Minor Illusion - the sound of an angry, stampeding triceratops, as if it's rampaging somewhere in the general area. In response, we hear the sound of a *real* stampeding triceratops to the west.
    * It successfully distracts a couple of guys, but most are too stupid or mindless.
* Alatu ungagged Mwax and then made her chug some Dream Tincture. ~~When the princess disappered: "See, she doesn't want to be here."~~ Well, the princess didn't actually disappear though.
    * Mwax sputters angrily. "How dare you gag me and force me to drink this foul liquid! Help, they're abducting me!"
* Sekelok told the party to surrender. The party did not surrender.
* Lureene un-alived some un-dead, but this left her open to attack by the Broodguards, and she went down. (They weren't trying to kill her, though, so she was auto-stable.)
* Alatu used Chill Touch on Mwax for some reason.
* Just then, in through the north door... came none other than **Ras Nsi** himself.
  "What's going on down here, all this commotion?!"
  Then he stopped with a gasp. "Such... beauty before me!"
  Mwax thought he was talking to her, until he added, "And those *scales*...!"
* He slaughtered the Broodguard between him and Molly, casts it aside, and approached her... "Marry me, and we will be unstoppable. We will usher in a new age of darkness as Dendarr's loyal servants!"
* Molly laughed in his face. "Bold of you to assume I'm not *already* unstoppable!" And she whacked him with her hammer.
* He actually got hit! And took over 20 damage! But he's like, either the penultimate or final boss, dude. We *might* have cracked his first shield bar. He told his guys to stand down.
* Alatu tried to re-gag Mwax and take her away. Sekelok responded by not standing down, and he downed Alatu.
* Meanwhile, Creed hauled ass trying to get back to the party. He could see Lureene go down, and as he dashed into the fane, he saw that Alatu was down as well, *and* this final-boss-looking asshole was in the room.
* Ras told Sekelok to get Mwax out of his sight. "She's useless to me!" To Molly, he said, "Look, you guys are way outmatched. Why don't you stand down, and come to dinner." (Also he orders somebody to capture Creed.)
* *Finally,* Molly attempted to negotiate. "If I'm Queen, how dare you treat me this way! You have to court me first and also how dare you attack my friends!" (At 6'7", they're about the same height, depending on how much of his snake body he's standing up with.)
* Creed noodled past the baddies and got himself into a tunnel, where his Tunnel Fighter feat will work great. Come at me, motherfuckers.
* Karnassus, who's been hiding in the harem this whole time, is discovered by Sekelok as he's taking Mwax away. Karnassus tries to bluff and intimidate Sekelok.
* Ras Nsi orders his guards to *grovel* to Molly, and they do. (The undead just un-animate.) "See?"
  Molly: "That's better! But it's disgraceful how you treated my comrades. What reparations will you make?"
  Ras Nsi: "What do you want?"
  Molly replies she wants her companions given the royal treatment, their wounds attended, and kept safe, and so she knows where they are. Miraculously, he *agrees.*
* Creed takes the opportunity to Lay on Hands and help Lureene up. Lureene is *extremely* confused and kind of shaken, but lets Creed lead her to the corner, where the party's starting to get into a huddle. (Molly fetches Karnassus and the unresponsive Mwax.)

They explain the situation. Ras is in love with Molly for some reason, and that gives us leverage. We still fully intend to kill Ras and all the other bad guys, but this gives us a chance to rest and heal up and everything first.

Molly returns to Ras and insists that her party be within shouting distance at all times. This includes Mwax, who "will make a fine handmaid."
Okay. A malison takes Mwax away to be branded. (Lureene objects, but Molly says that's better than her being killed.)

Creed investigated the fleshy stew in the cauldron... it kiiinda looks like people.
    Ras Nsi: "Help yourself! It's tasty."
    Creed: "Uhh, what's in it?"
    Ras: "Mostly human, some tabaxi."
    Creed: "I'll pass..........."

The party splits here.
* Molly will be meeting with Ras Nsi in private.
* Alatu and Creed will go with Molly, hanging out just outside the chamber.
* Lureene and Karnassus will go to the baths to heal, clean up, and rest.

## Ras Nsi's Chambers

Creed and Alatu are in the antechamber, where the throne is.
Ras does something to a secret door, and he and Molly just... vanish.
A bodyguard hangs out at the throne room.

Creed: What's it like working for Ras?
Guard *(who barely speaks Common)*: Sssstrong... Massster.
Creed: Gotcha. My master is strong too. ... They ever let you sit on that throne?
Guard *(blocking the throne with his spear)*: No!
Creed: Nonono I'm not gonna sit there, it's cool. Hey umm, what's with the zombies?
Guard: Rassss... raisssse.
Creed: Have you heard about the curse?

The guard has trouble making himself understood, but *seems* to be saying he hasn't heard of the Death Curse.

Meanwhile, Alatu checked out a disc on the floor engraved with a snake. She can tell it's magical, but not what it does. They settle in for a short rest.

## The Baths

Two Broodguards escorted Lureene and Karnassus into a room with a rickety platform surrounding a snake pit.
    Lureene: "*This* isn't the baths, is it?"
    Karnassus: "No."

They enter a room to the south, where various yuan-ti are relaxing in pools... full of blood.
    Lureene: "*Ohhhhhh* no. Absolutely not."
    Karnassus: "Oh. Oh. Yeah, *these* are the baths."
    Lureene: "Were they like this in your time??"
    Karnassus: "Yeah, but back then it didn't bother me."
Lureene was unwilling to hang out in the blood pool room, but there was a sauna adjacent, where two enslaved people were helping a yuan-ti malison shed his skin. This was marginally less gross, so Karnassus and Lureene decided to rest here. (Lureene had to take off her armor because otherwise she'd have gotten heatstroke.)

## Ras Nsi's Chambers

Ras Nsi, taking Molly into his opulent chambers, asks her what brings her to Omu.
Molly says it's an academic pursuit, she's looking for the Soulmonger.
Ras claims he hasn't heard of it.
Molly: "Uhh, that thing causing the Death Curse?"
Ras: "Lol, never heard of that either."
Molly: "It prevents people from being resurrected? People who *were* resurrected start withering away?"

As she's saying that, she notices Ras Nsi, under his bandages, seems to be withering away, too... *just like our employer, Sindra.*
So, he's totally affected by the Curse.
Molly tries to provoke him indirectly, like "Yeah, resurrection is for chumps! You're only cool if you don't die in the first place!"
(It seems to be working.)

Ras asks what all she knows about it.
Since... even raising the undead, he's been having trouble with keeping them raised.

Ras: "Who's causing it?"
Molly: "Some plebian named... *Acererak.*"
Ras *(shocked)*: It *can't* be.

He slithers over to a desk, and opens up a sealed scroll, reading through it.

Molly: "What's wrong, *darling?*"
Ras: "Well, you've brought me unfortunate news."
Molly: "About the curse?"
Ras: "About Acererak."
Molly: "That peasant?"
Ras: "He's no peasant, he's extremely powerful."
Molly: "More powerful than *you?*"
Ras *(not even fronting)*: "Oh, yeah. By a *lot.*"
Molly: "It sounds like you two have a history..."

Ras explains that he and Acererak have a *contract.* The yuan-ti guard the Tomb of the Nine Gods for Acererak, and in return, he'll help them summon Dendarr from the Peaks of Flame.
    But check it out! It looks like Acererak is fucking you over!

Ras Nsi is *pissed.* He didn't *know* Acererak was causing the curse!
    Molly says, "Hey, that'd be a great wedding gift, wouldn't it? Killing the lich for his slights against you?"
    Ras *(excited)*: "So you say yes??"
    Molly: "Uhhh, *maybe.*"

Ras wants revenge on Acererak, but his position is tenuous - his second-in-command is about ready to launch a coup on him.
He offers:
    * to withdraw his guards from the temples.
    * to allow the party safe passage in and out of the Temple of the Nine Gods.
    * to give us the one puzzle cube he has.
Molly counters:
    * "You're a pussy for not taking care of the second-in-command issue already."
      Ras decides he'll deal with it while we're in the temple, then.

Molly asks to see Ras Nsi's contract with Acererak.
    Ras: "What is mine is yours, my Queen."
    Molly: *(I fucking hate this guy)*
Molly: "We'll investigate to see if the temple and stuff is adequate."
She reads the contract and tries to pocket it, but Ras notices.
    Ras: "Uhh, I *am* gonna need that back."

Presently Molly tells him she shall retire for the evening, and Ras acquiesces.
Molly takes the cube that he gives her, and returns to the antechamber.
And though Alatu is still there, Creed is nowhere to be seen...

# Next Time on Dragonball Z

* I imagine we'll find out what Creed's doing behind our backs. That's right, he's not exactly interested in cooperating with a necromancer, is he...
