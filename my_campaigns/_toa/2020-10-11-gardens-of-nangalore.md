# Day 59

bugspray: yes (55 remain)

Woken at the crack of dawn. Why?
"Long flight. Much long flight."

ushered to the temple, where there are 5 aarakocra with weird contraptions on their backs.
"good morning!"
ashara is like "if it is a good morning, since you're maybe going to your deaths."
    lureene isn't speaking to her.

nefer is flying eridian, cause friends.
everybody gets harnessed in, tandem parachute style.
as the aarakocra
the contraptions turn out to be deployable hang gliders.

they drop us on some dry land just outside a swamp,
as night falls.
we camp.
the aarakocra will wait 2 days for us.
there are distant lights but we can't tell what.

in the night, eridian and creed see a pile of something.
parrots will occasionally be startled by noises from the temple.
but nothing attacks or anything.

# Day 60

the sun rises and we can see.
the garden is a raised platform, carved with elephants and dinosaurs and stuff.
5-foot-tall terraces, with archways in various stages of collapse.
stone faces between archways.
it's hella overgrown.
domed buildings.

turns out the pile is a pile of corpses!
they're all armored.
they seem burned, and their equipment is similarly damaged.
but we find some healing potions.

alligator in the water. we kill it easily.

garden is hella overgrown.
birds are starting to squawk angrily.
    better get the coat hangers.

all sorts of rare plants and shit.
eridian is having a field day.

suddenly, dwarf zombies! being controlled by vines! also they're naked!
we kill 'em and burn the weird vines.

check out the faces, and the Omuan inscriptions with it.

Zalkor√©: a queen who's jewel of the jungle
Zalkore was worshipped by her people and by Thiru-taya who loves(scratched out) betrayed(scratched in) her
same face on all the faces, just with different expressions.

passing by another recessed garden:
alatu is grabbed by a tri-color flower and pulled in!
    each of the three flowers gets its own attack.
    one gas requires a con save,
    one gas requires a dex save,
    and one shoots out its gross stamen or something.
there's a bunch of yellow gas down there.

- alatu sets them on fire.
- molly one-shots one of the plants.
- lureene falls off the terrace trying to get to alatu.

the largest building is a ruined palace.
the roof has fallen in, in some places.
elephant carvings on the corners,
    weathered and crumbling but still magnificent.

in the next garden, there's a Mantrap. we avoid it.

eridian has been using Detect Plant to look for the thing.
it's up here, apparently, in what was once a royal apartment.
a long divan in the center.
on the divan, a woman in parrot feathers.
next to it: a potted black orchid.

lureene: who are you?
zalkore: you know me, my love. i'm zalkore.
    the rest of you are my subjects, what boon do you want?

molly asks if we can have audience and she says yes.

she's like, supernaturally attached to both an urn and the orchid.
eridian burns some incense to give her a bonus
    and miraculously seduces zalkore!
    gives a bouquet worth a lot of gold, and a skull.
as we're leaving, queen's like "hey where you going?"
eridian: "what do you mean? i'm right there. you're holding me."
zalkore: "oh, so i am."
