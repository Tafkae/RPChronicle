## Tomb Entrance (Fake)

Party takes a short rest at the obelisk so that Creed can heal up.


## Tomb Entrance (Real)

The Unkh necklace brought Karnassus to a second passageway with a similar setup to the first.
There's a similar stone door to the fake entrance, but with 9 holes.
Karnassus puts all the cubes in the holes, arranged in opposition as before, with Unkh in the center. The cubes glow, then disappear, and the door opens.


## Timer Room

another door slab
iron lever set in the door's surface, up position
above the door is a graven skull, leering down.
as molly and karnassus enter, a skeletal hand thrusts out from the skull's mouth, holding an hourglass, which flips over. 10... 9... 8...

karnassus, remembering what happened the last time there was a countdown, pulls the lever.
the floor goes out from under them!
karnassus manages to grab the lever and not fall.
molly falls into a poison spike pit and is impaled and poisoned.

creed helps her out & she gets healed up.

karnassus pushes the lever back up.
the floor closes and the countdown begins again.
this time, the party does nothing...
and when the countdown ends, the door opens. oh, okay.


## Devil's Hallway

An overgrown hall with a carving of a bearded devil's face at the far end.
The devil has a black void in his mouth.

As they enter the hallway, Molly and Creed step on pressure plates and get hit with poison darts. Ow.

As Creed gets to the devil, he can sense a bunch of evil energy in the devil's mouth. Lureene hucks a pebble into its mouth. It makes absolutely no noise as it disappears inside. But a few seconds later the pebble came back out and hit Lureene for 1 dmg.

There's a T-intersection at the devil.
- To the left is a **rusty grate** and a **crystal window**. (6ft x 10ft, another chamber is visible through it.)
  Below the grate, muddy water flows very slowly toward the **northeast**.
- To the right is a **railing** overlooking some other room.

Karnassus sees an aura of Illusion on the devil face.


## West: Tomb of Obo'laka

Lureene looks through the window.
Inside the room is a vaulted tomb.
    A stone sarcophagus.
    2 statues of bears, holding a bronze disc embossed with a dozen glaring eyes.
    6 dessicated corpses are slumped in thrones around the walls.
        each wears a feathered black mask.
Orvex thinks this room is set up in honor of Obo'laka.
    cause of the feathered headdresses, bear statues, etc.
Lureene wonders if this is related to the line "don the mask or be seen."
And perhaps the line "in darkness it hides" refers to the darkness of the devil's mouth...


## Atrium

A room with a huuuge pit, many levels deep.
There's some huge stone shapes down there, but even with Darkvision nobody can make out what it is.

Creed notices a figure perched on the walkway a level below them, wearing a mask that looks like the bearded devil face. The figure retreats when spotted.


## East: Tomb of Moa

Down a corridor to the east, a giant, moss-covered stone skull with flaming eyes keeps watch. You can make out the room behind it through its teeth.

Skulls crusted with dried blood are in niches everywhere.
There's a sarcophagus with a snake on it. (Moa.)

Behind the sarcophagus is an ornate crystal box, with a small humanoid skull floating inside of it. Looks like a child sized skull.

Moa's lesson: "Secrets hide the truth."
"Speak no truth to the doomed child."


## North: Tomb of Wongo

The hallway is lined with carvings of soaring birds.
A propeller with adamantine blades takes up the hallway, but it's off.
    The whole hallway leading up to it is pressure plated.

Karnassus is still Flying, so he hovers over the pressure plate.
The propeller seems to be connected to it, yeah.
Creed still has some adamantine bars, so they wedge one underneath one of the blades. Karnassus lands on the pressure plate The blades jerk but get stuck.

There's a pit with a sarcophagus, monkey-like creature carved on the lid.
There's a treasure chest on a dais, lid made of rusty iron.
    There's 3 chests actually:
        left: black onyx
        middle: rusty iron
        right: silver, encrusted with frost

The monkey is Wongo.

Orvex says:
> Onyx represents strength.
> Iron could represent a lot of things, but *rusty* iron...?
> Silver represents magic.
> The birds... I think that means the propeller kicks up a lot of wind.

All 3 chests have an abjuration aura, so they're probably magically trapped?
The sarcophagus has abjuration and evocation.

As Lureene enters the room, she sees a skeleton in the corner. Standing on the ceiling. It looks at her.
Lureene: "Uhhh... hi?"
Its lower jaw has been replaced with a stone triangle.
It doesn't speak when Lureene addresses it.

Karnassus flies up to the opposite corner and stands upside down on the ceiling. The skeleton looks at him, but does not act.

He proceeds to check out the chests.
    None of them appear to be trapped or even locked.
Karnassus goes behind the iron chest and opens it.
    He hears something click.
    The chest appears to be empty, but there's a keyhole with a 3-inch gold key protruding from it, from the inside of the lid.
Lureene opens the onyx chest.
    Inside is exactly the same thing.
    The keys do not turn or come out while the lid is open.

"The keys turn on the inside only."
Do we have to be INSIDE the chests?

Alatu uses Unseen Servant. It goes into the silver chest and gets locked in.
She puts her familiar, a snake, into the onyx chest.
Lureene crawls into the iron chest.

It works; once you're inside, a latch releases and you can get the key.
    Lureene counts to 3 and Alatu has her dudes turn their keys at the same time. Success!

But the chest is still locked. HMM.

They press the silver button, and the silver chest opens.
    The gold key is on the bottom.
    However, the Unseen Servant has been unsummoned.
With Alatu looking through her familiar's eyes, they press the onyx button.
    The familiar is crushed to death!
    But then the onyx chest opens and the gold key is inside.

Lureene is a BIT CONCERNED when they tell her this.
They try to pry the chest open, or move it, but it doesn't work.
Finally they feed some Dream Tincture through the cracks in the chest.
    It takes some doing, and they end up using 4 doses to get Lureene 1 full dose, but finally she falls asleep.

Presuming she's disappeared, Creed presses the rusty iron button.

Lureene is curled up inside, asleep, clutching a golden key.
    (So she didn't vanish.)
But she's not wearing her chainmail armor.
Actually, she seems to be missing a *bunch* of stuff.
    *Everything metal* on her has turned to dust.
    Her money, her armor, metal parts of her weapons... her family signet ring.
    Fortunately, her Mace of Disruption and +1 wooden shield are okay.

This was an unusual dream tincture experience.
Her entire dream was, she was dangling over a gaping hole in the earth, feeling like her spirit was being dragged from her body.

As they drag her out of the chest, she wakes with a start, as if from a nightmare (which is accurate). Creed assures her she's okay.
She realizes her armor is gone, along with her sword (which was a gift from her brother) and her signet ring. She's sad about that, but glad that she's alive. And she does have her magic weapon & shields.

Meanwhile, the sarcophagus transforms from stone to crystal, revealing the a mummified su-monster (it's Wongo), holding a dreadful-looking mace.
    Karnassus says it's a Mace of Terror, to strike fear into your enemies.
    "That sounds cursed," says Lureene.
    "I think it's just supposed to make you scared," says Karnassus.
    "Well, it's working," says Lureene.
The buttons are replaced with keyholes.

Creed inserts the keys we found, and opens up the sarcophagus.
They can tell Wongo is undead (a mummy, specifically), but not animated currently.
As Creed picks up the mace, he hears a monkey voice cackling. "You have to let me in! You won't survive this dungeon without me!"
Creed says, "Yeeeeah, that's not gonna happen."
    He puts it down on the floor.

Karnassus casts Remove Curse, then touches it. He hears the monkey voice.
"Your friend wasn't smart enough! But you - you have to let me in! Now!"
K: "Hi. You're not coming in, but you can talk with me if you'd like."
No response.
K: "Well, good news, it's not cursed. Bad news, it's still talking."

Lureene takes her Mace of Disruption and smashes the mummy's face in. It starts to get up, but on the third strike it disintegrates.
    So, she may or may not have just solo'd a god! She feels pretty good about that.

Alatu tries to hold the skeleton's hand. The skeleton follows her down the wall and stands on the floor.
She takes the skeleton's hand, and it seems to follow along with her while she does that.
When she lets go he starts trying to move away, but yknow, he follows her as long as she's holding his hand.

Karnassus receives the **Mace of Terror.**

# Next time on Game Grumps

Let's keep this streak of good luck going, hopefully!
