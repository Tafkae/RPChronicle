## Day 40

rations: yes (8 remain)
bugspray: yes (73 remain)

even though we didn't sleep, we feel rested. yay!
we head back down without resistance. the steps are all clear of everything.
eridian SPRINTS back down. but at the bottom, the ziggurat is surrounded by blue tulips.
to azaka: "is tonight the night?"
"yes. tonight is the night."

(eridian totally draws from the deck of many. because of course paul cant resist the siren song of RNGsus.)
(but the rest of us don't even know she has it.)

we cross the river.
accosted by three GIANT crocodiles.
lureene took off her armor and had eridian carry it, like before.
    so when she got up on shore, a croc swooped up and tail swiped and bit her,
    which took her down immediately.
    alatu quickly stabilized her, though.
azaka turned into a tiger-looking hybrid creature!
lureene got away and managed to throw her armor on.

azaka tried to jump on the croc's back but actually beefed it this time!
so lureene jumped up on it and stabbed it.
    eridian was the one who actually finished it off though.

azaka ran off into the jungle as the battle ended.

without azaka, we travel back up the cliff and head back onto the mesa.
camp there.

eridian sneaks away from camp during the night.
azaka sneaks back in during the night.
we now know she can do the whole tiger thing.


## Day 41

rations: no, and add 1 (9 remain)
bugspray: yes (72 remain)

eridian takes azaka aside for a private conversation.
    she was trying to get Wish so she could cure Azaka's lycanthropy.
    but she failed.
azaka says you're foolish for putting yourself at risk for that, but she's secretly grateful.

drizzly weather. uneventful.


## Day 42

rations: yes (8 remain)
bugspray: yes (71 remain)

rainy but not too bad.

flying monkeys encountered at night.
tried to recruit them but they weren't into it.
(turns out they hate combat.)


## Day 43

rations: yes (7 remain)
bugspray: yes (70 remain)

we'll reach m'bala around lunchtime.
eridian tells azaka that nanny pu'pu is a hag and we're gonna deal with her.
    the oracle told us she ate her entire village!
