*What do you MEAN you had an airship this entire time?!*

-----

> Do you remember... at Camp Righteous?
I wanted to go into the statue,
but there were traps and traps and traps
and everybody kept pressing forward
even when we kept getting almost sliced in half.
> 
> I felt awful.
We could have died. We nearly died.
And it was all my fault.
What was it for?
A jug of infinite mayonnaise.
> 
> But everyone said it was fine.
They didn't know why I was upset.
"It's fine," you all said.
"That's just what happens when you're adventuring!"
> 
> So, okay.
That's fine.
It's just what adventurers do.
They rush into danger and make stupid choices and hurt people.
> 
> I came here looking for adventure.
I wanted to prove myself.
To prove that I don't have to be coddled or sheltered.
That I can take care of myself.
That I'm strong.
> 
> ... But I'm not.
> 
> Oh, physically, sure.
I beat Yingmatona in a single blow.
    Nearly killed him! An innocent man!
But I shouldn't have fought him at all.
    I should have refused.

Fly spell top speed: 6.81 (repeating of course) mph
airship top speed: 22 mph
accel 4.4 mph/round -> .733... mph/sec

we can't catch it. within 10 seconds it's faster than us.
we can only get within 280 feet of it before it pulls away.
our spells won't reach.

we aren't fast enough.


lureene flies and flies after it, not until it's out of sight but until it's very very clear it's going to get away. and a little past that.
then she gives up, hovers in midair, and swears at them a while.
then she heads back to the temple.

she's quite drunk.

next time:
we'll put our heads together and decide what to do.

-----

creed is confused as to why lureene's still hanging around.
he thinks she hasn't bonded with anybody in the party.
    
she's bonded with YOU! or she thought she had!
you seemed like a real hero.

creed tried to refuse the dance... but then he gave in.
and now he's doubling down and insisting "we're trying to help."
some help we've been!
    eridian: nefer's your friend. he believes in you.
        you shouldn't have let him give up his wings.
        you didn't say a word. (verify with paul first)
    alatu: you're always trying to do everything yourself.
        you think you're right all the time
        and you won't listen to anybody else.
    molly: you can't leave well enough alone.
    creed: even if you're wrong, you lie to yourself
        to convince yourself you did the right thing.
    and me: i'm the worst of all.
        because i KNEW it was wrong,
        but i was too much of a coward to say so.
        well, no more.

do you know why i came to chult?
it was to prove myself.
to prove that i don't need to be coddled and sheltered.
that i'm capable. that i'm STRONG.
    well, i was wrong about that.
    i'm not strong at all.
    not in any way that matters.

why did we take asharra and nefer's wings?
because we thought there was no other way.

why do i stick around?
because i know this is bigger than me.
it's like i said to asharra.
    yeah, i'm in over my head.
    i don't know what i'm doing.
    there's a very real chance i'm going to die out here
    and my parents will never find my body.
but i have to try.

if i can do something to stop a great evil
then it's an even greater evil not to try.

Kae
oh MAN dnd was intense tonight
so much intra-party conflict
i love it
my character spent rather a lot of it sitting on the floor in the corner of an inn room while crying and drinking a flask of wine

Grimme
Oh man. :open_mouth: What happened?

Kae
well - do you mind spoilers for Tomb of Annihilation?

Grimme
I don't play modules these days, so spoil away!

Kae
alright! so
we were in this aarakocra village and we've baaaasically been tripping over our own dicks and messing everything up with them ever since
we were supposed to clear out a legendary garden to make it safe to visit again! ... buuuut in so doing, we killed the creature that was magically keeping the plants alive, and now the plants are all dead and nothing will grow there for several centuries

Grimme
welp

Kae
there was a sort of political conflict where a human prince and princess, the last survivors of their civilization, were living with the aarakocra under their protection. Prince Na (age 6) is a fucking scientific genius and the sweetest little kid you ever did see; his sister Mwaxanare (age 17), on the other hand, is a spoiled brat and delusional idiot who just wants people to wait on her hand and foot at all times (and has acquired magical powers to enforce this)
Asharra, the aarakocra leader, had zero fucking control over Mwaxanare
and just responded to her outbursts by appeasing her and cleaning up whatever messes she made
(they had a box labeled "Explosion Repair Kit")
but Asharra also seemed kind of willfully oblivious both to Mwax's machinations and to the fact that half her people think Mwax is in charge of the settlement instead of her
the party sided with Asharra, so every time we've found out something Mwax was doing we've reported it to Asharra, but of course that just leads to a screaming match and no actual consequences for Mwax anyway
and yet, even after Asharra told us "you've done enough damage" and not to talk to Mwax or Na anymore, what did pretty much everyone do? continue talking to them
and every time it just made the situation worse XD

Grimme
D:
"It'll definitely make it better this time!"

Kae
haha
so anyway. Asharra had agreed to help us cause we needed to get to Omu faster. (Omu is where the big bad necromancer is, presumably within the titular Annihilation Tomb. it is also the civilization Mwax and Na are royals of)
she was gonna do this through a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, which essentially allows her to give up her wings - permanently - to grant us three days of flight
we didn't realize the flight we got would be temporary until it was almost time to do the ritual
also we needed six days to reach Omu. so another aarakocra, a fellow named Nefer who the party rescued once, offered to do the ritual as well, which would give us all six days.
even at this point, we could have refused. Creed actually tried to refuse (and Lureene, my character, was bolstered by that cause she also wanted to refuse), but Asharra talked them into it
because, you know, we have to get to Omu fast! we've heard word that the undead are rising across the continent! the curse has spread throughout the settlements. Port Nyanzaru is burning!
we gotta defeat the necromancer and end the curse, and we don't have 20 more days to traipse through the jungle!
so, with that time pressure, we opted to have them do the ritual.
that was last week's session.
cut to this week
Creed had established a rapport with Na. (Creed's like in his 40s or something and kind of the Team Dad, to give you an idea.)
he wasn't supposed to talk to him, but he happened to run into Na while passing by the kid's house, and Na struck up a conversation. (and Creed was like "well teeeechnically HE initiated it, so i'm not breaking any rules by talking to him")
Na has a hobby of building little paper flying machines. so Creed (and another party member who's kind of incidental to this part) decided to ask him like hey, maybe he can put something together eventually so that Asharra and Nefer can someday fly again
In so doing, he revealed to Na that Asharra, who has been Na's teacher and mentor and basically the closest thing he has to a mom right now, gave up her wings forever so we could go take back Omu
Na is six years old remember
i might be getting events slightly out of order but two things happened here
1. Na revealed to Creed that he'd secretly built an airship at Mwax's "request" (demand)
2. after finding out about the Asharra thing, Na freaked the fuck out, fell off a cliff and Creed had to fly down and catch him. but even then Na didn't want to talk to him anymore afterwards
so yeah
the TL;DR is
two of our allies gave up their wings forever so we could get to Omu quicker. for the greater good. because we thought there was no other way.
BUT MWAX AND NA HAD AN AIRSHIP. THE ENTIRE TIME.
ALSO THE AIRSHIP IS LIKE THREE TIMES FASTER IT TURNS OUT.
we found this out because, with Na having a BSOD and Mwax being super fucking done with everything,
the kids took the airship and left for omu on their own

Grimme
Oh my gooooood

Kae
the last four sessions: wow it'd be tough to screw the pooch any harder than this!
this session: hold my beer
so yeah
Lureene was already kind of having a crisis of conscience at this point
before the garden thing, we all had to prove ourselves to Asharra, and "proving herself" is one of Lureene's central character motivations so she agreed to it
she was asked to duel a particular guard. so she did. and she beat him in a single blow, which dropped him out the "moon door" (hole in the floor) where they were fighting
Lureene freaked the fuck out thinking she'd just killed this guy, and went all the way to the bottom of the cliff to try and find him. but he wasn't there
which led her to think the aarakocra were just fucking with her
she storms back upstairs and screams at Asharra like "do you think this is a fucking joke"
and is told, to her great surprise, "no, he didn't throw the match, you actually won fair and square. you really did best him in one blow."
(but also he's fine cause they have a pact going with these wind elementals or something who caught him)
Lureene's still mad cause 1) it was so fast it didnt' feel like a fair fight, and 2) she almost killed an innocent man, on the orders of his own leader, for no good reason
so then the garden thing happens, and lureene feels guilty about all the beautiful rare magical plants dying (she was the one who started combat against the thing keeping the plants alive)
and then they come back, they almost refuse the ritual, but then go through with it. Asharra and Nefer will never fly again.

Grimme
:open_mouth:

Kae
Lureene swears to them, then and there, that they won't let this sacrifice be in vain.
then Alatu (our party necromancer) decides she's gonna try to appeal to the aarakocra's elemental allies, despite having no idea how to do that, to try and give our pals their flight back
party druid (Eridian) joins her
Mwax actually has a secret pact with one of these elemental guys herself, so she ends up being the one to summon him lmao

Grimme
Of course she does

Kae
Lureene just thinks this is a colossal waste of time, and the elemental guy confirms it: returning their wings is beyond their power, it would require either a Wish or direct intervention from a God
Alatu: ok well is there any way we can balance this out and make it right?
Lureene: hey ive got an idea, we can do that by not letting it go to waste.
Alatu: lol shut up kid i'm an adult.
Elemental guy: the kid's right actually.
so after the elemental guy is dismissed, Lureene feels vindicated and confronts Alatu (who has pretty much been talking down to her the entire campaign), being like "see, i was right, it was a waste of time, you're doing this out of guilt but it's too little too late, and we need to keep moving forward."
but Alatu interprets that as Lureene being callous and not feeling any guilt
Lureene goes off on her like "how dare you say i don't feel guilty about this, of course i do, stop treating me like a child!"

Grimme
:open_mouth:

Kae
(she is the youngest party member at 17 incidentally)

Grimme
Zounds.

Kae
so Lureene storms off looking for Creed, cause she feels closer to him generally, wanting to vent
but Alatu runs into him first, and when Lureene sees this she goes full drama teen internally, like "oh, okay, so now she's gonna tell him a bunch of bullshit so he thinks she's right," (Alatu actually didn't mention their argument to him at all)
our other fighter Molly, the player couldn't make it tonight, so that's not an option
and since Eridian the druid was helping with Alatu's ritual earlier, Lureene assumes she'll take Alatu's side as well
so, unable to vent to anyone in the party, Lureene gets some wine from the kitchen and drinks alone while thinking about her life choices for a while!
and then, a little later, there is a noise: a magically amplified voice. mwaxanare's voice.
"SEE YOU LATER, BITCHEEEEES!"
this is the airship escape you see.

Grimme
amazing

Kae
lureene kind of stumbles out to see what's going on
and realizes
there was an airship
there was an airship the entire time
the dance of the seven winds was literally for nothing
and that is just. the last fucking straw for her.

Grimme
incredible

Kae
so the party kind of accidentally regrouped after a brief attempt to chase the much faster airship
Asharra's there with some priests and they're trying to work out what to do about this situation
she's already asked us to leave as soon as possible... but Creed just had to talk to Na one more time
so now Creed's approaching Asharra like "hey, we'll go after them"
Asharra: "yes, please do, immediately, do not stay here another minute, that would be great"
Creed: "is there anything you can provide us to help us catch up faster"
emphasis lureene's
Lureene goes off on him like "haven't they done enough for us? haven't WE done enough? all of you, quit trying to squeeze them for everything we can get!"
Creed: "go home lureene you're drunk"
Lureene: "MAYBE I WILL" /doesn't
so yeah that's pretty much where we're gonna pick up next week!!
us desperately trying to catch up to Mwax and Na before they get themselves killed, if we don't manage to tear ourselves apart first 8D
it was glorious
Lureene has had a lot of character development over this campaign and i'm so here for it

Grimme
Oh my god, this sounds glorious.  Can't wait to hear how it turns out!

Kae
:heart: i can't wait either
lol the whole group was kind of reluctant to hang up the call
Lureene's deal is, she belongs to a minor noble house but has kind of grown up sheltered and coddled, so she decided to go on a grand adventure far away and prove she's a strong competent adult
the realities of the adventuring life were... a bit of a shock for her!
i think the first real inflection point was when she wanted to check out an ancient ruin at their campsite, but it turned out to be packed to the gills with stupid death traps despite its small size, and we had a couple people go unconscious just from that
(cause we took forever to figure out the gimmick that disabled the traps)
(it was: you have to do the whole obstacle course piggyback)
and the reward at the end: an alchemy jug! which can produce a few gallons a day of about 12 different liquids. one of which is mayonnaise.
so i call it the jug of infinite mayonnaise
it's come in handy a couple of times but only for the drinkable water
and once for booze

Grimme
gross

Kae
hahaha
but anyway Lureene felt just awful that she'd been so gung-ho about delving the ruin, feeling that it was her fault the others in the party got hurt
when she expressed this though, the others kinda brushed it off like "hey no worries, that kind of thing happens when you're an adventurer! and also we wanted to delve it too"
she accepted this answer but has never really been satisfied with it
so they keep traveling, and keep getting word from Nyanzaru about how the undead situation there is worsening. Lureene is very concerned about this since their job is to get rid of the curse that's causing all that, and the longer they spend walking around the jungle, the worse things are going to get
starting to feel the time crunch, they headed to the aarakocra village where they'd been told maybe they could learn to fly
aaaand the rest is history
Lureene has been a little shy about speaking up when she disagrees with the others, since they're all older and more experienced and generally seemed to know what they're doing

Grimme
She's growing. ;w;

Kae
yis :heart:
she knew it was wrong to duel an innocent man, knowing the terms were death or submission. she did it anyway, because she felt the stakes were too high to refuse.
she knew it wasn't right that they take away their allies' wings permanently to get temporary flight
but she kept telling herself, "the greater good, the greater good. we have to stop the curse. there's no other way."
and then it turns out: there was another way
and it was a better way
in every conceivable sense

Grimme
Bless her. :>

Kae
so yeah i don't know what's going to happen going forward, but this is galvanizing her moral fiber i think
i'm really excited for it
and i'm curious to see how the other characters will respond to it
