## McDemon's Stomach

Alatu was dangling over a sarcophagus.
Molly lowered them down into the room, then tied off the rope on the demon's ear or nose or something, and followed.
Lureene joined them in the room.
Karnassus continued holding the hand of Skeleton A so that Alatu could come over and "befriend" Skeleton B.

Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes.

A gold-inlaid funeral barge atop a 3-ft dais.
On the barge is a gold sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits (almiraj).
The floor is covered in hieroglyphs.

Exits:
up: to **Shouty McDemon**
south: corridor, through a set of fangs, likke the reverse side of the mouth in the doomed child's room
east: hallway blocked by a large stone slab.


As Alatu stepped down from the dais, the four sphinxes yawned and stretched... and a swarm of locusts came out of each one's mouth!
The swarm went straight to Alatu and began biting them all over! In a single turn, they went down.
Molly tried to apply bug repellant, but all she got for her trouble was *half* the swarm of locusts biting all over *her.* Since she was down to like 1/5 hp, she went down, too.
The locusts immediately returned to Alatu and resumed eating them alive.

Fortunately, Molly had called for help before she went down.
The others rapidly joined them.

Karnassus noticed a weird purple mold along the wall, with eyestalks coming out of it.
Lureene jumped down and flung some firebolts at the locusts, but there were too many of them!
On the next round, they picked all the flesh from Alatu's bones, turning *them* into a skeleton.
Just like that, Alatu was gone.

Molly gathered up her bones and they all agreed to, uh... head back up the rope.

Lureene reported Alatu's death to Orvex and (wherever Creed is).
Molly handed the bones to our skeleton friend, who... actually accepted them, oddly enough.
Orvex was more curious about what happened. He started taking notes. (when he let go of the skeleton hand, it tried to wander off, so Molly took some rope and tied it to her belt.)
They decided to try the other path.

## East: Chessboard room

Checkerboard marble floor.
A gilded coffin sparkles in the sunlight streaming in from overhead.
    (This despite that we were far underground...)
4 gargoyle heads protrude from the walls, open-mouthed.
The room smells strongly of wine.

On the way to the room, there are two passages that curve upward and out of sight,
too steep to climb.

corpse of a half human half goat - human torso, goat legs.
    (Lureene's heard of a few similar races)
Karnassus notices the corpse is holding a staff topped with a goat head.
    It has a transmutation aura.
It appears he was killed by wounds caused by axes and crossbow bolts.

Molly went straight to the sarcophagus and kicked off the lid.

"Drown your sorrows."
The moment she read it, a huge stone slab descended from the ceiling and sealed off the doorway. Wine began to gush from the gargoyles' mouths, covering the floor.
Karnassus narrowly dodged it and fell into the room.
Lureene and the others were trapped outside.

- Lureene tried uselessly to move the stone slab.
- Molly took Alatu's bones and put them in a metal cage, and put them into the stream of wine. "These are the sorrows I'm carrying, and I'm attempting to drown them."
    It didn't do anything, but she got an Inspiration for this.
- Molly tried to use her Cold Breath on a gargoyle head to freeze the wine. 
- Karnassus realized the sunlight was an illusion, so that wasn't a way out of the room.
  The gargoyle faces were not magic. Inspecting the mechanism, he could see some kind of valve that had been opened. It was a 2-foot by 2-foot tunnel.
  He cast Fly on himself and squeezed into the tunnel, propelling himself by magic.
  At the other end, he found a full cistern of wine... with something *swimming* in it.
  It's called a **wine-wierd**. Water elementals, but tainted by wine.
  It didn't seem to notice him, but he couldn't close the valve.
    He immediately juked on back. "yeeeah there's a creepy monster up that way! but I think there's some kind of mechanism."
- Lureene hollers after them. "Molly! Karnassus! Can you hear me? What's happening?!"
  Red liquid began to seep through the cracks around the slab.
  In her panic, she thought for a heartstopping second that it was blood, but - wait, blood doesn't smell like grapes.
- Molly tried to put the sarcophagus lid back on! (It was very light, the whole thing seemed cheap.)
  This did nothing.
- Then Molly tried to squeeze her way up one of the other tubes. Not having darkvision, she couldn't see shit! But there seemed to be something on the other side?
  She reported this to Karnassus, somehow, despite being immersed in wine.
  She did not answer Lureene though.
- Karnassus tried that tube. There weren't any wine-weirds in this one, luckily! But there wasn't a mechanism up there either.

- As the wine was coming out pretty steadily now, Lureene told Creed to take Orvex and get to the staircase. She'd go up the slope and see if there's anything she can do there!
  As she ran up the slope, though, it didn't seem to BE a slope... gravity was still pulling her down. She ended up running through the whole loop and out the other side. 
  It looked like the same hallway, only she couldn't see Creed and Orvex to the west, and to the east, the slab was open, the room clean, and no sign of Molly or Karnassus...

- Meanwhile, 3 wine-weirds blooped into the wine room!
- Molly kicked the lid off the sarcophagus again, but there was nothing inside. She'd just let it fill up with wine.
- Karnassus cast Fly on Molly as well, then began trying to make his escape through the unoccupied tunnel.
- The wine-weirds went after Molly, opening itself up and trying to engulf her, crush her with wine pressure!

- Lureene ran up to the checkerboard room.
  Her voice echoed off the walls, and she couldn't hear rushing water or anything.
  So, she began running up the ring again, in the same direction.
    "The ring is a path to another tomb."
    
- Molly followed Karnassus up the wine tube, dragging her skeleton friend with her.
- Karnassus and Molly arrived in the next room.
  The air reeks of sulfur and brimstone.
  A pentagram of salt surrounds an ornate sarcophagus,
  which is decorated with images of dancing froglike humanoids.

- Lureene continued running forward. Another empty checkerboard room, and no corpse.
  Shit! So she started running back the way she came.

- Molly stepped across the salt line, and immediately a Gray Slaad appeared and bit her arm! This knocked her unconscious somehow.
- Karnassus lifted her over the salt line and healed her.
- The Slaad summoned a greatsword...

- Lureene only had to make one circuit to get back where she originally was.
  So, cool, she's back here, she's lost one friend, she's about to lose two more, and she *doesn't know what to do* -
  Just then, she heard a booming voice in her head... laughing.
    "Feeling lonely, now, are we?"
  Angered, Lureene doesn't answer.
    "I'll give you one chance to give up," the voice (presumably Acererak) said.
    "Like hell," Lureene hissed.
    "As you wish."

- Molly attacked the Slaad, but her hammer pretty much bounced off its skin.
  So she attacked with Bookmark, and *that* pierced its thick moist hide.
  It still didn't seem to care, though.
- Karnassus recognized it as a Gray Slaad, a planar being.
  They're generally sent from another plane by some other entity just to cause mayhem.
  He tried to get away from it.

- Lureene still didn't know what to do, though, and it seemed the room was now *completely* full of wine. Her friends were probably dying in there and she was powerless to help.

- Karnasssus flew up to the ceiling.
- The Slaad looked at Molly, then began casting a spell toward Karnassus...

- Lureene headed back into the other tomb, and found the sarcophagus sparkling in the sunlight. The markings didn't seem significant, just decorative.

- Molly and Karnassus kept fighting the Slaad.
- They couldn't prevent him from casting the spell, though. He cast a huge ball of fire up at Karnassus. Karnassus took it directly to the face and plummeted from the sky.
- Molly heard in her mind: "Just the two of us..."

- Lureene took out her raincatcher and held it up to block the beam of sunlight. Nothing *immediately* seemed to happen, except the sarcophagus was no longer illuminated.
  So the question is... does she kick it open and probably die, or does she give up and cut her losses?
  After thinking about it for a few seconds, she lowered her raincatcher, packed it up and walked away.
  She's decided... "I'm probably going to die in here. But I refuse to die *alone.*"

- Molly went one-on-one with the Slaad. It got off balance long enough for her to shove a healing potion down Karnassus' throat.
- The Slaad took a giant fork and jabbed it into the ground, and a flaming fissure opened up - it disappeared into it. A few seconds later, another fissure opened near Molly, and the Slaad reappeared, looking *less wounded*. Hip hip hooray.

- Lureene reached the intersection in *her* world's Tomb *juuuust* in time to see the slab rise into the ceiling... releasing a torrent of wine! **OH FUCK.**
  She ran as fast as she could, but still got caught up in it and was nearly knocked over the railing into the darkened atrium below...
  But she managed to hold on to the railing (thank fuck for small mercies) and didn't get knocked over the edge.

- Molly and Karnassus *finally* managed to kill the Slaad. It exploded into slime and pus! Gross. (2500 xp *each.*)
  Inside the Slaad's body, Karnassus found a gem. (These are implanted in their brains as control mechanisms, so there's probably a paired gem... in another plane... somewhere. It's kinda useless by itself though.)
  
Atop the sarcophagus were a dozen hand-carved frog statuettes.
Molly broke a grung statue off the sarcophagus and kept it, then kicked the lid off the sarcophagus. It was way more satisfying than kicking off the cheap one in the other room.
Within, there was a varnished clay urn; inside were the skull and bones of a grung, and several other small items: a potion vial, and a petrified grung egg.
As she picked up the egg, a small froglike head was formed out of ooze and crawled up Molly's arm. She heard a voice in her head...
    "Nangnang will help you now!"
    She failed her Charisma save, so it melted into her arm and disappeared.
