*Our heroes question the Yuan-ti slavemaster...*

---

# Yuan-Ti Stronghold (cont'd)

## Slave Pits (entrance)

Exits: South (outside), North (door)

Creed cast Zone of Truth on the slavemaster, but he succeeded the save while the entire party failed. Immediately, *he* started asking *us* questions, and they had to answer. Lureene got annoyed at this "reverse" interrogation, and they dragged the slavemaster out of the Zone. Creed asked him if there was any reason to keep him alive, and he said "No, I'll never give you information," soooo Creed killed him.

The slavemaster had an iron key, a red headdress with malachite gemstones (250gp), and a golden hand mirror (75gp).

Molly, having forgotten the entire interaction with Rachel from last time, went to talk to her again. She actually *managed* to inspire some hope, and convinced Rachel to leave the grotto and hide out with Dennis; however, they'd have to escort her out. Molly agreed, and Lureene went with her in case they run into a patrol.

3 kinds of yuan-ti
1. pureblood (mostly human looking)
2. malison type 2 (snake head, human body)
3. malison type 3 (human head & torso, snake legs)

## Storeroom

Exits: Southwest (to Slave Pits), Northeast (to )

Creed and Karnassus checked the door for traps, and found none. The key fits perfectly! Creed opens the door - and is immediately entangled by a giant snake.

The party roars into action, attacking the snake. But after one round, the snake disengages and backs into a corner, and in fluent Common begs us to stop and let him live. Though surprised by this development, the party does so.

The serpent's name is Azi Mas. When asked, he explains that he was once friends with a druid who gave him the power of speech, but that druid perished in the jungle. Azi Mas eventually wandered his way into Omu and entered the service of Raz N'si. (This is our first real confirmation that Raz N'si is present in Omu.) It's his job to keep inventory of this storeroom, as he has a very good memory.

Lureene told Azi Mas of the Death Curse his master caused, that Port Nyanzaru has been ravaged by the undead because of it. Azi Mas was doubtful - Port Nyanzaru is a long way away, and though Raz N'si is powerful, he isn't *that* powerful. Lureene corrected herself that it was actually the work of his master, the lich Acererak. That particular lich was unfamiliar to Azi Mas, but he recalled that his druid friend hated liches.

When asked about the contents of the storeroom, Azi Mas revealed it contained general trade goods and supplies. The only interesting thing was the "mesmerizing incense," which the Yuan-Ti used in their rituals. He said it makes them "go crazy" - more specifically, they stand around looking dumb for a bit and then start flailing everywhere and screaming. Hm...

When asked about Mwaxanare, Azi Mas remembered her as "Raz N'si's fiancee." He expected she'll be in the harem, which is near the Fane. (The Fane being a sort of temple or shrine.)

## Underground Corridors

Exits: West (up ramp, to Hall of Serpents), South (to Azi Mas's Storeroom), East (to ???), North (to ???)

the storeroom and all has tile floors and torches and nice smooth walls. this is a much more intentional design. karnassus says its human and minotaur architecture.

minotaurs: always evil, monstrosities. intelligent, speak Abyssal.
but some become enlightened, and came and joined human civilization.
this happened primarily in Chult.
there was some art in Nyanzaru of the Omu times, with humans and minotaurs working together.
they're not particularly associated with labyrinths but they do tend to live underground.

the passageways down here are 5 ft wide, 20 ft tall.

LEFT: a ramp leading up into the Hall of Serpents.

## Hall of Serpents

Exits: North (to Hall of War), East (to Corridors), West (to Armory)

A 20-ft wide hallway with pillars every few feet. The pillars have intricate engravings depicting Yuan-Ti worshippers doing *horrible things.* Each one is different, but the only one we get a close look at is the first.
1. The door to the underworld swinging open and releasing the Serpent (probably Dendarr), who devours the Sun and plunges the world into darkness.
2. A Yuan-Ti malison (who seems to be someone important) wields a flaming sword and wearing a crown with a black opal, leading the snake people to the underworld. (This is the kind of malison that's snake from the waist down.)
  * Lureene speculated that this might be Raz N'si. Alatu confirmed that this was the Yuan-Ti she'd seen marrying Mwaxanare in her tincture dreams, who is (also speculated to be) Raz N'si.
3. A giant serpent coils in the underworld, devouring the dreams of sleeping creatures.
4. The Yuan-Ti are terrorizing the populace of Chultans, feeding their nightmares to the Great Serpent.
5. Same as 1.
6. Same as 2.
7. Same as 3.
8. Same as 4.

Karnassus recognizes it as the Hall of Serpents, which is a monument to the past and (prophesied) future of the Yuan-Ti.

There are more broodguards up ahead. We almost send Karnassus up to assess the place, but Karnassus remembers he's bad at deception and suggests another way to the Fane. Oh yeah, apart from the inner sanctums, Karnassus knows his way around this place! That'll help.

## Hall of War

Exits: South (to Hall of Serpents), East (to Fane?), North (to ???)

Where the Yuan-Ti muster before a raid.
There are several Broodguard here.
Since there are like 6-10 of them, we have Alatu open with a Goreball for crowd control! She hits ALL of them.
(Aaaand there's more of them in the back!)

Alatu: THERE'S A LOT OF THEM, GUYS!

Unfortunately, none of them go down just from that. WELP.
Battle ensues!

* Broodguard: What should I do?!
  Commander woman: Go sound the alarm!
* Creed chases down the fleeing Broodguard, beating him to the big ol' war gong (which is the alarm). He kills the guy quickly.
* Something VERY LARGE has begun to move. It's a Triceratops!
* As Lureene enters the room, she recognizes two foes to the left as Basilisks. (8-legged lizard things with glowing eyes and spine-covered backs.) These are extremely dangerous: if they see you, and you can see any part of their body, you have to save vs. Petrification! If you avert your eyes, though, you're safe from that.
* The Yuan-Ti woman is stuck underfoot of the triceratops, but manages to get away and unchain one of the basilisks.
* Molly runs up (with no caution whatsoever) and kills the shit out of the woman.
* Alatu and Lureene both try to blind the basilisk, but their spells fail.
* Molly fails her first petrify save but succeeds the second, and they take down the basilisk in short order.

Meanwhile, the Triceratops stampeded *away* from the fighting - into the second group of Broodguards and their Malison commander. They managed to subdue it, but it fell in such a way that it blocks the *entire* entrance to the Hall of War from their side.

Alatu tried to give the injured dinosaur some Dream Tincture to heal it, but was stopped when Karnassus and Lureene insisted it was the only thing between them and the other guys - who aren't aware there are intruders. This is actually a boon, it buys us some time. (Creed and Lureene cut down the alarm gong and left it on the ground, just in case.)

Where's the armory, Karnassus? "Oh, back the way we came." ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW.

## Armory

Exits: East (to Hall of Serpents)

The Armory was sealed with a magic lock. Creed tried his iron key, but predictably that didn't work. Molly tried to shove it open (and failed), but with some help from Creed, Lureene managed to force it open, though she fucked her shoulder up a bit in the process. (Creed was kind enough to heal it a little.)

Inside, a large skeletal snake guarded the armory. Surprisingly, it spoke Common, demanding the passphrase. "So Ukurlahmu has spoken," it said (after literally every sentence). Turns out Ukurlahmu was the snake's name. 

Karnassus was able to pull rank on Urkel, convincing it that we were defending the complex from the Red Wizards of Thay (since we know for a fact they're in Omu somewhere). Urkel allowed the party to enter, and take "what you are allowed."

However, the only item of interest was a shield fashioned from a large tortoise shell, which Karnassus pointed out was enchanted. When Lureene approached it, Urkel made it pretty clear that was *not* among the things they were allowed, repeating its demand for the passphrase.

Lureene went back to reexamine the engravings in the Hall of Serpents, which were interesting, but didn't provide any insight. #2 was most interesting, as it seemed to depict someone important, but when she asked Karnassus about it, he said it didn't appear to be anyone from Yuan-Ti history - unless he was from the last 50 years that Karnassus missed. Lureene speculated that this was Raz N'si... Still no idea what the passphrase is, though.

Lureene returned to the Armory, where Creed was clearly champing at the bit to kill this undead abomination. She looked over to Creed and said, conspiratorially, "I think we've got some *clean-up* to do."

Creed, not needing to be told twice, drew his Holy Avenger. "Ukurlahmu, have you ever seen a weapon like this before?"
Urkel: "No such weapon has been entrusted to me, so Ukurlahmu has spoken."
Creed: (dubiously canon) "Well, you won't see its like *again*, either."

(Because we're going to kill you. That's the implication. We're gonna kill the snek and take his turtle shield.)

# Next Time:

* Kill Urkel and take his turtle shield.
* Seek the Harem and rescue Mwaxanare.
