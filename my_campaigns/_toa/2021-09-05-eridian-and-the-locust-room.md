*Old friends are reunited; an old puzzle, put to rest.*

# Day 76; Noon

Creed asked Alatu what she knew about the mold.
Alatu told him:
> This stuff spawns in the lair of a beholder.
> The eyes are remote appendages of the beholder.
> Not much else is known about it, since researchers who go in to test it don't usually come back.
> But fire or holy light are good for clearing it out.

Lureene knew about Beholders.
They're aberrations from another realm.
generally they're pretty evil! *Shocker.*
They're really smart, too - they're cunning, they lay traps for people.
She's heard of evil wizards making *deals* with beholders.
They're extremely magical and have an aura of anti-magic about them.
Each of their eyes can do a different magical effect, which are great for crowd control.

## Hallway NW of waterfall room

Creed entered the mold-encrusted hallway and found:
- a 1" hole in the wall, about 6 feet up. (Creed suspects tomb guardians.)
- a door on the right side of the hallway (leading east)
- a bend at the end of the hall (leading west)

Molly opened the eastward door.

## Horcrux Room

Inside was a font full of steaming green liquid. Ah, another one of these.
A darkened figure stood with its back to the party, wearing chainmail and holding a warhammer.

Molly stepped forward. The figure stepped forward.
Ah, one of those mirror puzzles! It was mirroring her movements.
She started juking to get it to move.
It followed. She tried to make it fall into the font, but it phased through it instead.

Molly figured it wasn't a threat, but Creed thought they ought to get rid of it anyway.
Molly moved around talking to it, observing it as she did...
    It hadn't turned to face her, but it looked *like her.*
    She got the feeling it had the same Strength as her, but was a lower level.
She decided it was an illusion, just here to distract us.

Molly went back into the water room to try and make the thing go into the hallway.
But she turned around forward, and the duplicate was suddenly facing Creed.
Creed noticed it looked *exactly* like Molly - except for the silent scream of absolute horror etched across her face. His heart skipped a beat - and then didn't get to the next one. It just... stopped.
    Creed immediately dropped to 0 HP. *(He crit failed his wisdom save.)*
Molly ran up and dunked a Potion of Supreme Healing down his gullet...
    But for some reason it did 11 poison damage to him instead!!

Lureene got her healer's kit out and stabilized him, then dragged him back to the waterfall room and tried to rouse him.
Lureene: "Molly, are you *sure* that was a healing potion??"
Molly: "Yeah! It says right here on the label-" *(label peels off, behind it is a skull and crossbones)* "- oh god dammit."
    She remembered she'd gotten that potion from a sarcophagus *inside* the Tomb.
So, Lureene gave Creed a potion she'd brought in from outside the tomb, and that one worked like normal.


Molly maneuvered it back into the room.
But as she did, she heard Nengneng's voice in her head - "There's gotta be something worth taking in that font!"
Molly replied aloud, "The last thing I took outta here poisoned Creed! That's not worth taking."
The green stuff in the font *looked* gross, but to her, it *smelled* delicious...
She had her copy eat all the goop. When the goop was gone... the copy disappeared!

At the bottom of the basin was another eyeball, one inch in diameter, this one crystal orange.
Molly took this as well.

Out in the hallway, Molly lifted Alatu onto her shoulders to look through the tiny hole in the wall. The hole was perfectly circular.
At the other end, as if through a bunch of lenses, she could make out what looked like a gold medallion.
She tried to put her red crystal eyeball in, but it just kinda fell back out.
Alatu said, "I want to get a closer look at that."

(Molly then continued giving Alatu a piggyback ride for a while.)

## Northwest Hallway Cont'd

Molly went **west** and found a door.

On the door was a painting of a 7-foot-tall jackal-headed humanoid with a gold medallion on its chest.
The medallion bore the image of a devil face, 6" in diameter, through whose mouth you could see an image of a jackal.
All around the humanoid were carvings of locusts.

She figured she could pull off the medallion, but also one of the locusts turned out to be a button.
First: she tried to pull the medallion off. This was easy.
Behind the medallion was a clay disk with various hieroglyphs on it, but she couldn't get that.
But then a corrosive gas spewed out!
    Molly took the full brunt of it, 56 acid damage, so she went down.
    Alatu took half damage, so she didn't.
Creed rushed up and gave them both 10 points of healing, and they regrouped at the horcrux room.

## Horcrux Room

The party debated what to do next.
- Lureene thought any interaction with that door was going to be bad news. They need to go in through the top.
- Creed admitted that's what Acererak's clue *said* to do, probably, but he wasn't sure how much stock they should put in his words, since he *is* trying to kill them.
- Molly said they should check out the hole again, see what they could figure out.
- Alatu didn't care one way or another as long as she didn't get eaten by locusts again.

Well, as long as they were hanging out here for 10 minutes, Creed went ahead and cast **Prayer of Healing.**
Lureene was concerned that, as you step on the pressure plates, the "which one is safe" indicator (where the devil mouth was) might change as well. Like, the clay disc would rotate.
So the plan was: Molly will stay behind in the hallway and shout out what hieroglyph is on the bottom.
    But how would we hear her through the closed door...?
    Ah! Lureene gave Molly her Tortoiseshell Shield of Yelling Real Loud.

## Meanwhile, in the sarcophagus room...

Elsewhere, *someone* was coming down through the devil mouth, but the rope broke and she fell onto a gold sarcophagus on a barge. The only other things in here were some sphinxes, a dwarf skeleton, and a standing skeleton with a polygon jaw.
She cast Detect Magic. The sphinxes were magical.
The hieroglyph tiles on the ground were all pressure plates, and the dwarf looked like he'd been eaten by bugs... Better not fuck around with that though.

Welp, she's stuck.

## Horcrux Room

Suddenly, Molly and Eridian began to hear each other's voice in their head!
    (As it turned out, you can hear and talk to the people inside the room while you're looking through the peephole.)

Eridian: "I've got myself in a bit of a bind here. I was trying to catch up with you. I'd finally convinced Artus that this *was* where he needed to be, we got into the tomb, but then he went off to keep an eye on Ras Nsi while I headed on down. And then I went into the devil face in the dark, but the rope broke, and now I'm on a boat surrounded by pressure plates..."

Everyone: "What's going on?"
Molly: "It's Eridian! She's in the boat room where Alatu died!"
Eridian: "Alatu died?!"
Molly: "She got better."

Molly relayed this info to the party and relayed Creed's words back and forth.
They explained the puzzle to Eridian. "We *think* the vulture is safe to step on. Also we *think* the medallion protects you from the locusts."
But they were now reluctant to press the locust button, in case of locusts.
Eridian opted to turn into a spider, which was too light to trigger the pressure plates, and exited the room though the jackal face into the atrium.

Lureene pressed the locust button and ran!
A click sounded, and the stone door sank into the ground.
Eridian saw the recording of the dwarf.
    She reentered, and the dwarf's effects rotted away.

Molly entered the room and stepped on the Vulture. (Creed stayed outside to tell her the next symbol.)
    As Lureene predicted, the disc then turned!
Next symbol: Snake. Molly stepped on it and the disc turned again.
Door -> Reed -> Scarab -> Scepter -> Foot -> Urn.
Big click: The door opens, the sarcophagus pops open, and Molly and Eridian heard a bunch of tiny clicks from the pressure plates. The trap is (probably) disarmed!

Lureene entered the room and stepped on the plates in the same order. They didn't depress as she walked on them, though.
She messed it up and skipped Foot, but nothing happened, so yeah, they're disarmed.

Eridian looked into the sarcophagus. Inside, she saw the fragile bones of an almiraj, and a spiral horn that radiated magic. It was a **Wand of Wonder**... but after a second, streamers of light came out of the tip of the horn.
The light coalesced into a spectral almiraj, and Eridian heard a small female voice:
    *Quick! Quick! Let me in! We must stop Acererak!*
Lureene warned her real quick - "Be careful with that!"
Eridian succeeded on the Charisma check, though, and was like "That wasn't so bad."

Lureene explained how the artifacts in the sarcophagi try to get inside your head.
She showed Eridian the one she found in Papazotl's tomb, which she was still wearing.
Eridian assured her she'd resisted without much trouble though.

Lureene went over and searched the body of the dwarf.
Molly heard Nengneng's voice: "Are you just gonna let her take all that great loot...?"
    Molly pointedly walked in the other direction.
The dwarf was Bravus from the Company of the Yellow Banner.
    Lureene found a peridot gem on his turban, worth 500 gp.
    One nonmagical shield.
    belt pouch with 500 gp worth of diamonds.
    two 1-inch diameter crystal eyeballs, one blue, one purple.

Eridian brought the standing skeleton out of the room.
The skeleton had a **pentagon** jaw.
She handed the skeleton off to Alatu, who grudgingly thanked her.
    Then Alatu ripped the jaw off the skeleton, which crumbled into dust.
Eridian sensed something amiss about Alatu, since previously she'd been against harming her skeleton friends, and Creed explained Alatu sort of "came back different"...

## The party regrouped in the Horcrux room to take a short rest.

While Eridian passed around some heals, the party filled her in on what all had happened since she'd been off with Artus.
Orvex, the skeletons, Karnassus, Karnassus' death, and so on.

Then Lureene asked Eridian what she'd been up to.
    She was very happy to see Eridian. Well, we all were.

Eridian: "Me and Artus went up to the city of Mezro that Artus's honeyboo was at, and that was still gone-zo, but I was able to talk with some of the tree spirits nearby, which Artus didn't think to do (and also couldn't do cause he wasn't a druid), and I found out the biggest obstacle to the city coming back *is* Ras Nsi existing. So Artus decided, well, we gotta 86 Ras, and we came down and found out Ras is in fact, pretty powerful. We couldn't take care of him by ourselves. So he said, hey, you remember those friends of yours? And I was like yes, those friends of mine, who you took me away from, yes, I remember them. And he said all right why don't you go get them. So we gathered up the cubes, opened the door, and I came in to get you guys while he kept an eye on Ras Nsi."

Lureene: "So what now? Do we keep going, or backtrack to deal with Ras Nsi?"

Eridian: "Well, we can't go back. When I came to the door, the door was closed, so we had to re-collect all the cubes to get back in. If we go back up, the door will be closed again - we can't get out the way we came in. The only way out is through."

During the short rest, Eridian cast divination to find out, "What's the best way to get Alatu back to normal?"
   The answer: *"Bathe her in the waters of the magical well."*
She told only Creed about this.

# Item: Wand of Wonder

*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

Weight: 1 lb.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already.

If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

| d100 |  Effect |
| -- | -- |
| 01-05 | You cast **slow**. |
| 06-10 | You cast **faerie fire**. |
| 11-15 | You are stunned until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened. |
| 16-20 | You cast **gust of wind**. |
| 21-25 | You cast **detect thoughts** on the target you chose. If you didn't target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage. |
| 26-30 | You cast **stinking cloud**. |
| 31-33 | Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn. |
| 34-36 | An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01-25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an elephant appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears. |
| 37-46 | You cast **lightning bolt**. |
| 47-49 | A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes. |
| 50-53 | You **enlarge the target** as if you had cast **enlarge/reduce**. If the target can't be affected by that spell or if you didn't target a creature, you become the target. |
| 54-58 | You cast **darkness**. |
| 59-62 | Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute. |
| 63-65 | An object of the DM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. |
| 66-69 | You **shrink yourself** as if you had cast **enlarge/reduce** on yourself. |
| 70-79 | You cast **fireball**. |
| 80-84 | You cast **invisibility on yourself**. |
| 85-87 | Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours. |
| 88-90 | A stream of **1d4 × 10 gems**, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand's tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line. |
| 91-95 | A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw or become **blinded** for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| 96-97 | The target's skin turns **bright blue** for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected. |
| 98-00 | If you targeted a creature, it must make a **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw. If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly **petrified**. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the **greater restoration** spell or similar magic. |
