*Augh! Everything I touch is ruined*

-----

gotta love when you're being attacked by a monster, and attack back, and get hit with a spell, and fail your save, and get shoved back into the scenery, and loudly accuse the monster of petrifying a bunch of other people, and *directly request your party members' help*....... and they still dont want to roll initiative.

so anyway, yeah.
they FINALLY realize this is a combat.
creed Blesses lureene, and she shakes off the petrification spell.
zalkore reveals her sneks and draws two short swords.
    3 attacks!
she also summons a ghost friend.
creed goes down a few times,
but we defeat zalkore.

the feather dress on zalkore is worth 50g
the golden headdress she hid the snakes in is worth 25g.

sound: a bunch of crashing and things falling over.
the plants have withered and fallen and died, the moment zalkore died.

we go ahead and set up a pyre to burn zalkore's body.
since that's happening, creed tries to take the dress...
    but the ghost friend is still there and like. settles into him?
so creed says the dress is probably cursed and we should burn it too.

but uhhhhhhh alatu realizes, CREED IS HAUNTED AS FUCK.
creed: oh shit. how do i fix this?
alatu: idk.

eridian tries to use her druid magic to bring back the garden to life,
but something *stops* her magic.
she realizes, this place has been propped up by magic for way too long.
all the life has been sucked from the soil, it's totally infertile.
the land needs to rest, and will be barren for a long time.
    welp.


# Day 61

bugspray -> 54

lureene feels guilty. it's kinda her fault all the plants withered.
eridian reassures her, though, that it was an unnatural garden anyway.
    it will grow back someday, and be natural.

on the way out they see a giant spider whose web they fucked up.
eridian speaks to animals to it, tells it there won't be any prey here for a long time, and it should probably relocate.
    the spider nods and leaves.
she also talks the last few crocodiles into leaving.

the party burns the remaining bodies they find,
and we go meet up with our aarakocra buddies.

alatu says "creed's got a ghost in him."
hmm, the aarakocra no longer want to take him along!
alatu: "did i say 'ghost'? i meant 'GAS!'"
finally they agree, because we're nefer's good friend.
    creed will be bound and gagged for the duration.
off we go, we're flying back!

it will take two days to get back, since they're not gliding.

let's make camp.
forage is plentiful, and the night is uneventful.

rations: 8 -> 8

# Day 62

bugspray -> 53

today we reach the monastery.
our escorts start un-equipping,
but two aarakocra rush to us very quickly.

1: "teacher! summon! now!"
2: "princess! dragon and smelly! now!"
    (that'd be alatu and molly. respectively.)

alatu and molly go with #2.
the rest of us will go see teacher.
    but #1 insists on EVERYBODY coming.
alatu: who's really in charge here, the teacher or the princess?
    1: teacher!
    2: princess!
so alatu and molly go with #2.

ritual time is soon.
    tomato ritual, that is.

we're escorted to the cleansing chamber.
dennis is being anointed with fancy clothes and oils.
    "i cleaned EVERYTHING," he explains.
    "i'm Honored Cleaner! a new title!"
everyone congratulates him on having more prestige than the rest of the party put together.

meanwhile, at the princess:
    the princess has cleaned up her act and got her shit together?
    she's realized molly might be able to help her reclaim her throne.
    molly and alatu have been appointed as advisors,
    but mwaxanare doesn't grasp that even your subjects get to have free will.
    molly: if you want an advisor, talk to Na!
        he's 3x wiser than you at 1/3 your age.
    alatu: actually, you could probably foist off all the hard work onto him!
    mwax: i don't wanna!
    molly: then i won't be your advisor, since you clearly won't be advised.
    mwax: what about you, stinky?
    alatu: BARFS
    mwax: BARFS
    molly: lol very regal your majesty
    mwax: SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET OUT.

meanwhile, at the teacher:
    asharra is waiting in the bath chamber.
    oh, we're in trouble.
    we weren't supposed to talk to the princess, and now she wants to leave. she thinks she'll have armies as soon as anybody's heard of her.
    creed suggests we should all talk to her and set the record straight.
    asharra is taken aback that even some aarakocra think mwax is in charge instead of her!
    so we'll head over there. asharra says "let me do the talking."

asharra: you've made the princess uncontrollable!
molly: no, YOU did that by spoiling her.
asharra: whatever, let's get this ritual over with.
creed: can we give Na his bug?
asharra: give it to me. i'll think about passing it on.

we tell her about zalkore and the gardens.
she's surprised zalkore was a medusa, but makes sense.
she'll send out some folks to try and help the petrified people.

anyway, time for the ritual.
    your destination is omu, 200 miles away.
    it'll take 6 days of flying. i can only grant you 3,
    unless another aarakocra gives up their wings too.
we decline that. we'll just walk the rest of the way.
    but nefer also offers his wings. nefer, no...

creed flat-out refuses the ritual,
he thought the flight would be longer-lasting.

but eridian adds:
time is of the essence.
nyanzaru is already under siege from the undead.

alatu asks about a third option: can we just ask the dukes of wind?
    asharra: not really, no.

we have a little while to think about it.

eridian goes and tells asharra what we know about mwax's plans.
asharra blows her off, but reluctantly agrees to set a guard.
    also she didn't know mwax could cast charm person,
    so she says she'll give the guard extra protections.

we ask about spell scrolls. there aren't any.
we ask about the potions of healing. asharra lies and says they're gone.
    but actually, they weren't potions of healing to begin with.
    they were totally poison.


anyway. we must take our shirts off and have wings painted on our backs with charcoal. asharra makes a circle on the floor. nefer brings a spare silvered glaive to replace creed's broken one, and creed trades him the old one at his request.

they do the dance of the seven wings, dancing around us and singing in auran.
grinds up the black orchid, and says "inhale."
    we all do.
one by one, asharra kicks us out of the hole in the floor.
and as we fall, we sprout wings!
we all come back up.
    nefer and asharra have bloody stumps at their wings.
    asharra declines healing, but nefer accepts.
lureene: thank you. we won't let this sacrifice be in vain.
