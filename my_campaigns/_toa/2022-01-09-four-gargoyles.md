# Day 77

## Memorial Service

**Creed**

> Creed will do his best to prepare the party for what to expect while they are making their way down to the tapestry room, explaining that he has already taken the time to prepare Molly's remains.
> 
> When they walk in, Creed sort of just motions toward the make-shift funeral pyre that he has assembled.  He has already dressed Molly in her preferred clothing (fancy pjs) and wrapped her whole body in the most joyous of the tapestries, hiding the rest underneath as a padded and raised platform of sorts.
> 
> As he motions toward Molly's body, Creed will tell the party that he has already paid his respects and will give them time to say any last words.  Once they have each had time to do their things, Creed will light the pyre to burn Molly's remains.  (Creed plans to do this silently, while reverently watching the pyre burn down.)
> 
> After whatever else happens, Creed will also mention that Molly's remaining belongings are stacked near the doorway.  "Take what you want/may need - she would have wanted it that way."

**Alatu**

> Alatu will sing a song during the burning. Something traditional.

**Eridian**

> Eridian would talk about Molly's finest hours, the times when she was the most "Molly". I think this would mostly be all the times she tried to negotiate with people who were clearly trying to kill her, but it is done with only a little humor at the start and evolves into a something uncharacteristically reverent for Eridian.
> 
> She will also join Alatu on whatever parts of the song she remembers from way back when we were on the anti-pirate boat. She talked with Alatu then about funeral rites to pass the time, so she'll work with what she remembers, but will fade out when her memory fails her to avoid getting in the way.

# Day 78

## Hallway outside Tapestry Room

### Shaggy disappears

Suddenly, while poking around the walls, Shaggy vanished into a secret door or something! They weren't sure if she'd done it intentionally or if it was a trap. Hope she's okay!

### Molly's stuff

The party divvied up Molly's stuff.

- Creed
  - pearl of power
  - scroll of pedigree, signet ring
- Eridian
  - python staff
- Lureene
  - chain mail (gave studded leather armor to Orvex)
  - silvered warhammer
- 15 rations - 3 to Creed, 6 each to Alatu & Lureene

### The Python Staff

As Eridian picked up the staff - before Creed could say anything - green smoke billowed out and encircled her. "Let me help you! I promisssse to be good..."
But she made the save, so it was fine.

Creed asked why these things would be here?
Orvex: The trickster gods were entombed here by Acererak.
Eridian: *Are* these the trickster gods?
Lureene: They seem like they are. But are they here to help us? To hurt us?
Orvex: He used their names to lure in the Omuan people, we think. People came here to worship, and never came back. And the creation of the tomb itself was an Omuan project.

Creed continued pondering all this.

## Downstairs Entering level 4

The party decided to head downstairs cause it feels like we've been in this dungeon for a fucking year.

There were 4 statues of gargoyle lookin guys, in different materials.

### Acererak's Fourth Warning (Plaque)

> Death to fire, dine or drown,
> precious air, and falling sand.
> The army sleeps in silence.
> The mirror holds twelve.
> Find the iron scepter's twin.
> The maze holds the key.

### Inner Atrium

4 Gargoyle statues, stone.
Pedestals 10 feet high. Top of pedestal is coated in metal:
  - N - Copper
  - W - Platinum
  - E - Silver
  - S - Gold
Each pedestal has a slot that appears to be for some kind of coin.

Pit in the center: mechanical noises from beneath.

**Exits**
- W - hallway
- E - hallway
- S - narrow hallway

### West Hallway

Huge stone door at the end, but no handles or hinges.
Jutting from the wall - matching bronze sculptures, head & neck of serpent with fangs
Plaque above the door, can't read from here
Smell of death from door
Small hallway to the north

A roar comes from the end of the hallway, followed by the stench of death.
Eridian sensed an Abjuration aura.

### East Hallway

Green devil face carving at far end
  Eridian noticed a little lizard hanging out in one of the eye sockets.
  Looked like an ordinary Chultan lizard.
Mural - Faceless humanoid figures doubled over in pain, clutching ears.

Orvex points out: the devil faces appear to be entrances to the tombs.

## East Hallway

This devil face seemed pretty solid, the others you could see thru the eyes and mouth and stuff.
Eridian saw a secret door, but before the others could get it open, Orvex called out that the gargoyle statues were moving!!
  Lureene: Oh god damn it.

- Eridian cast Call Lightning, summoning a thunderstorm into the atrium.
- A gargoyle jumped over and grabbed Orvex! Then dropped him, cause he'd gone limp.
- Another attacked Lureene and took out half her HP in one go.
- Another flew down the corridor and provoked AoO from everyone.
- Lureene pulled Orvex to (relative) safety, getting back to back with the rest of the party.
- Alatu - Vitriolic Sphere! A sphere of acid exploded but didn't seem to damage their stone bodies.
- Creed got on the other side of hallway gargoyle, attacked.
  It plucked Bookmark right out of his hand. Awesome!
- Lizard *(in Druidic)*: Not my tail again! Not my tail!
  Eridian *(in Druidic)*: It's cool, we're not gonna hurt you.
- Eridian continued calling lightning, healed Lureene.
- Gargoyle -> Alatu, 4 claws 1 bite. Alatu went down instantly.
- Other Gargoyle used Bookmark to use Dimension Door! (Gargoyles are magical, you see.)
- Lureene attacked, then Action Surged and cast Color Spray (lvl 2), maybe blinding it maybe not.
- Creed: I vote secret door or staircase! Your choice!
- Creed ran back, picked up Alatu, and Dashed to the staircase.
  Cast Shield of Faith on Lureene.
- Eridian continued calling lightning, healed Lureene again.
- Gargoyle blocking the door attacked Lureene. Mostly missed, but did a bit of damage.
- Everyone heard a rush of air from the north, vacuuming sound.
  Creed realized he had lost attunement to Bookmark. It's been either attuned or destroyed, but Creed guesses destroyed.
- Lureene delayed until after Eridian. Told Eridian to save Orvex.
- Creed did Lay On Hands on Alatu, updated her on the situation, ducked back into the hallway.
- Eridian continued lightning, cast Healing Word on Orvex.
- Lureene used Dodge.
- Gargoyle attacked her, missed all but one. Phew.
- Lureene Dodged again.
- Alatu cast Goreball. Nice!
- Creed moved up and attacked gargoyle. Defeated it!
- Another gargoyle moved into the gap. Creed AoO'd it.
  Attacked Creed for a shitload of damage.
- Gargoyle attempted to grapple Creed & Lureene!
  Lureene put out her hand to stiffarm it... it just fuckin fell over dead.
  *yooooo*
  Creed: High five!
  Eridian: Nah man those high fives kill!
  Creed: Knucks, then!
  Lureene: *(fist bunp)*
- Lureene stood her ground, Dodged.
- Creed dusted himself off and healed up.
  Taunted gargoyle. "You might as well come over and die like your buddies dude."
- Eridian kept lightning coming.
- Gargoyle charged, but Creed stopped him with AoO.
  Attacked Lureene, then Creed.
- Lureene Dodged!
- Alatu cast Chill Touch a couple of times.
- Creed swung an uppercut, then down, Divine Smite.
  Cleft him in twain!

Everybody gets 5900 xp!

-----

Eridian healed Lureene up a bit.
Alatu wanted a long rest.

### What became of Bookmark?

Eridian had heard this noise before when Molly tried to teleport.
Puzzle with a 50-50 chance of getting sucked into a black hole...
Apparently, the gargoyle failed, and took Bookmark with him.

## East Hallway

Eridian opened the **Secret Door** to the north.
Within was a tiny little room, with waves of heat blasting out of it.
Images of volcanoes and stuff...
A skeleton embedded in the wall, holding out a sconce with a red candle, lit.

Eridian asks lizard "Is it safe in there?"
  Lizard: "I dunno, the yellow ones tried to use me to set off the traps, but they didn't get this far."

Creed tried to use his halberd to snag the candle, but couldn't quite get a grip on it.

Eridian tried to use Druidcraft to snuff the candle.
It worked. The heat was still going, but the candle went dark.
  Eridian could sense the magic in there now:
    Abjuration, Conjuration, Evocation.
  Eridian tossed some seeds, in a bag full of dirt, into the room.
  Then she made the seeds grow, so there'd be a living thing in there.
  Nothing happened to it.

They decided the puzzle wasn't done, but needed to find someplace safe to rest first.
Lizard told Eridian there was a **maze** just up the stairs. He'd never seen anything up there.
  Eridian asked if it would guide them.
  It asked if they were going to return to the jungle?
  Eridian: Eventually, when we can.
  Lizard agreed, hopped onto Eridian's shoulder.

Eridian figured the lizard had had *Awaken* cast on it by a druid at some point.

## South Stairwell

Up the stairs -
A stone doorway.
Gaunt male humanoid in hooded cloak
  face is a mask of stars.
  Worn away from time.
  Withered left hand is raised, palm extended.
Eridian asked Lizard how the door opens.
  Lizard: The Tomb Guardians just do what the carving does.

Alatu raised her left hand. It worked, the door went down.

Wall carvings:
Crowds of humanoids fleeing a black star in the sky, with rays of light emanating from it. Wherever rays hit the people, they turn into dust.

Decided to camp in the stairwell, since maze is probably one-way.
Creed @ top, Lureene @ bottom.
  Eridian, Lizard, Creed on first watch.
    Eridian heard slight movement from the maze room.
  Alatu, Lureene on 2nd watch.
    Uneventful, nothing seen/heard, nothing happens.

During the evening, Orvex mused:
"If that's a place of tribute, I wonder if there's other money in those pedestals?"
