*Our heroes fuck around and find out*

---

The time is now **12:00 pm** or so.

Creed went ahead and healed Orvex, though he tried to decline, saying we should save our heals for ourselves.
Creed reasoned that his knowledge was invaluable though.

The party debated their next move.
- They could go back to the alternate dimension...
  What's the purpose of it, though?
  Orvex seems to think it's where Acererak *tests* his magical traps.
- Molly thinks it'd be a waste of time.

Ultim,ately the party voted to stay in this reality and head down to the next floor.

# Level 3

Reaching the landing, the party was struck with the stench of rotting corpses.
Creed noticed a bunch of purple goopy mold everywhere, which emits green smoke.
    Karnassus volunteered to check it out, since he's immune to poison.
    Creed pointed out he's immune to diseases.

Karnassus checked it out.
He noticed some tiny little eyeballs peek out at him, then disappear into the muck.
Everything about it felt *wrong,* like there was some kind of aberrant presence behind the eyes.
He reported, "I can't tell what it is, but I'd steer clear of it for now. It *may* be sentient?"
They asked Orvex if he knew anything about sentient molds.
    "There's all kinds of magical molds, some can form into monsters in deep dungeons.
    This being *everywhere*, it's either one massive organism or nothing of note."
    Which doesn't mean it's not a *threat* - it could still be dangerous.

Creed stepped forward. Down the western hallway, he noticed a pair of hulking **Tomb Guardians** in alcoves.
They had metal plates bolted to their bodies, and a chain connecting them by the necks.

They didn't respond to his presence, so Creed proceeded to the hint plaque. Molly followed (because she wanted to get in a fight).

## **HINT PLAQUE**

> Walk through water with weapon in hand.
> Slake your shadow at the font.
> The vulture is the first step.
> Right the gods.
> The walls of history tell all.

## North Hallway

A carving of a snarling jackal's head protruded from the wall.
The room was visible through its eyes and mouth.
The mouth had a very small jaw opening, only inches. It's impossible to crawl through.
    Yeah, it's that room.

As she was looking through, though, the opposite door ground open, and a dwarf came through, walking carefully with a golden shield out in front of him.
Lureene called out for him to stop, but he didn't seem to notice her.
First step: fine. Second step: *click.* Then locusts poured out of the sphinxes and ate him alive.
    Lureene realized this was an "echo" of sorts, she's just seeing how that guy died.
    But the body in the room didn't have a shield...
As she watched, the "recording" started to loop and play again. Okay, she doesn't have to watch this guy die twice.

"The vulture is the first step."
And clearly the second step isn't whatever he chose next.

## South Hallway

Lureene and Karnassus proceeded south to check it out.
A short, narrow hallway ended in a T-intersection.
Before they could investigate further, Creed and Molly called out that they're going to go check out the west hallway. L&K booked it back to the place.

## West Hallway

Creed and Molly debated their next move and decided to check out the West Hallway.
They called to the others that they were doing that.
Molly said she'd try to negotiate 

The guardians' eyes tracked Molly as she curtsied to them.
As she tried to sneak under the chain, though, they swung the chain down low and swept her backwards.

- Creed poked one of them with his glaive. Roll initiative.
- Lureene cast True Strike on Guardian N.
- Guardian N - raises arms, metal spikes come out of its forearms.
  Creed takes an AoO, 7 damage - it does nothing.
  With Divine Smite - still doesn't do much.
  It attacked Creed. OW.
- Guardian S did the same to Molly. OW OW OW.
- Karnassus healed Creed and Molly and ducked out of the way.
- Creed swapped to the Holy Avenger.
    Note: Everyone within 10 feet has advantage on saving throws against spells/magic effects.
          Also, you get to add +2 to saving throws if you're within 10 feet of Creed, just like, always.
  The Holy Avenger seemed to work *better*, but still not great.
- Molly used Bookmark to cast Dimension Door, intending to reappear behind them.
  However, she... didn't reappear! Woooo.
- Lureene cast Booming Blade on Guardian S.
- Guardian N grabbed Creed and lifted him over its head!
- Guardian S attacked Lureene but missed.
- Karnassus cast Guiding Bolt on Guardian N. Next person gets advantage.
  It seemed to be very effective!
- Creed attacked the chain in between them. This shattered the chain, disconnecting them!
  He then attacked the one holding him, with Divine Smite Level 2.
  It did a lotta damage, but only to the one.
  He cast Hunter's Mark on Guardian N. Focus fire on that guy!
- Lureene attacked Guardian N with her mace, but she rolled a 1.
  Guardian N *caught* her mace, and - although it couldn't pull it out of her hands - whacked Creed in the face with it.
- Guardian S picked up his end of the chain and started swinging it around!
  But he rolled a 1 and instead got tangled up in it.
- Karnassus cast another Guiding Bolt and killed Guardian N!
- Creed transferred his Hunter's Mark to Guardian S, then attacked the fuck out of it.
  It's restrained by its own chain, so you get advantage!
- Then Lureene started whaling on it with her mace. Woo!
- Guardian S. burst free from its chains and attacked Lureene, trying 
  It attacked again and finally got a hit in. Ow.
- Karnassus cast Eldritch Blast and killed it!
  It fell over and nearly landed on Lureene, but she dodged.

### A winner is you!

Which just leaves the question: What happened to Molly?

Karnassus: "I have a feeling she's got a plan."
Lureene: "This is *Molly*, though..."

# Corpse Pit

On stepping through her Dimension Door, Molly found herself in a pit full of decaying corpses.
A sneering devil's face was set in the wall.

Another being was there waiting for her. He was Large.
"I was wondering when you'd get down here! Didn't think you were smart enough."

She curtsied and introduced herself.
The other being introduced themself as Keshma al-Wazir, a Dao.
    "You're nicer than "
    "I've been trapped here for a millennia, in that bottle Acererak put me in..."
Molly: "I feel like that would make us instant comrades."
Keshma: "I mean, in theory, but I don't see how you're any use to me tbh."
Molly: "You never know."

Molly noticed an eye-stalk sticking out of the mass of corpses. Motioned to it -
Molly: "Is that a friend of yours?"
Keshma: "No, but I haven't let him see me yet."
    With that, Molly realized they didn't seem to be entirely corporeal.
Keshma: "Maybe I should, so he doesn't eat you."
    They manifested solidly, and the eyestalk cowered away on noticing them.
Molly: "Hey, it's scared of you! I like people monsters are scared of."
Keshma: "I'm having trouble with this puzzle. There's no logic to it, it's just random chance."
Molly: "That's kind of a trend."
Keshma: "See those levers in the demon face nostrils?"
Molly: "I'm guessing from all the bodies that it kills you if you pull the wrong one."
Keshma: "Presumably. I don't want to leave it to chance."
Molly: "What if you pull them both at once?"
Keshma: "Huh, that's actually a good idea. I'm surprised. Okay, I'll play along. Which one do you want?"
Molly (flipping a coin): "Call it in the air."

Molly pulled the one on the right, Keshma pulled the one on the left.

Keshma: "Even if this is the end of me, I'm glad it's doing something so reckless."
Molly: "Ayyy that's just the adventuring life!"

Several noises happened, and the mouth of the demon began to open up, sucking all the corpses into his mouth.
Keshma also got sucked in, grabbing the teeth and struggling to pull themself out.
Meanwhile Molly was magically lifted to the ceiling, avoiding the succ.
    She lowered a rope down to Keshma, but they couldn't catch it.
    Keshma was spaghettified, apparently.
    The hollering stopped, the creature in the corpses was also sucked in...

And Molly continued to rise through the ceiling.

It was dark for a while, then she started to see light.
She found herself standing in front of another devil face - one that looked very familiar...

# Tomb Entrance

Oh. Well, I guess she picked the correct nostril.
Though disoriented, Molly headed down the staircase to go join the others.

# Level 2

But... bad timing. As she reached Level 2, a secret door opened, and out stepped... a Tomb Guardian.
Molly fucking *sprinted* away from it.
The Guardian pursued her.

---

# Level 3

Molly came barreling down the stairs! She stopped when she reached Orvex and Alatu, but told everybody:
"There's another one! Don't teleport, we don't teleport here!"

- Molly attacked the Guardian with Bookmark. Crit!
- Karnassus attacked with Eldritch Blast.
- Creed ran up and squeezed into Molly's space to attack it, yelling in frustration.
  "STOP COMING OUT OF THE WALLS!"
- Lureene ushered Orvex and Alatu down the stairs to relative safety.
  As she got near the purple mold, Alatu said, "Ooh, Death Mold! Maybe I can kill someone with this later!"
- Creed botched his attack and nearly dropped the Holy Avenger down the hole. DON'T DO THAT...
- Molly attacked with Bookmark again, trying to knock him over! It didn't knock him down, but it did hurt him.
  Second attack whiffed though.
- Karnassus: Eldritch Blast!
- Creed: Stabby stabs!

The Tomb Guardian fell over the railing, presumably slain.

Karnassus inspected the Guardians for a mark he'd left inside another one's armor.
He didn't find one.

Karnassus however noticed that the skeleton friends were getting away.
Molly and Lureene ran after them!
Molly managed to corner one. The other ducked down a side hallway, but Lureene snagged it before it could go any further.

She did notice **another sarcophagus** down that way, beneath a sorta gazebo like structure whose name I forget. Portico?
Anyway, Lureene did not attack the gazebo.

Lureene asked Molly where she went.
Molly said she ended up in the corpse pit, and a genie was there, and she might have accidentally killed them.
Karnassus said, "Oh, *that* asshole."
    He finally related the story of the Dao he found earlier. He let her out, she teleported away...
    Guess we know where she ended up!
They tied the skeleton friends to Molly's belt again.

# Level 2

## Demon Face Room

The party headed upstairs to take a long rest in the cramped, but relatively safe, demon face room.
They had an uneventful night.
Several of them leveled up!

LEVEL 7 GET.

Sleepy sheepy.
