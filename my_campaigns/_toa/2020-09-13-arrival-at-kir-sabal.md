*Our heroes climb to the heights of Kir Sabal*

-----

what you know about aarakocra.
    from elemental plane of air.
    enemies of elemental evil.
    in the service of the Dukes of Wind,
    who have them scout the planes in search of temples of elemental evil.
    they spy on evil creatures and either fight them, or report them to the dukes.
    "planar gates"
    when not tasked to guard a gate, they're nomadic.
    they travel light.

from another plane.
generally considered Good,
help those that they deem worthy.
nomadic, not much in the way of possessions.
many don't speak common well,
but that doesn't mean they're stupid.

eridian, as an ANTHROPOLOGIST, tells us all about all that.
lureene relates a role that aarakocra played in a heroic epic (like an equivalent to beowulf),
    helping the hero once he proved himself worthy.
azaka does not want to go up, says she's fine down here.
    (she's afraid of heights.)

how do we get up?
you'll see. there's a climbing route, though it's difficult.

but actually, we have a flying monkey.
if we send him up with a note, introducing ourselves,
maybe they'll give us a lift?

"Hi guys, we're a party of adventurers, friends of Nefer.
We're here to take him up on his offer.
Also the ramp is in disrepair so if there's another way up that would be greeeeeeat"

this is a monastery.
it was not built by aarakocra, they just moved into it.
labyrinth symbol on big structure: you can only see it from the ground or the sky.
it's a symbol of Ubtao.
there is a way up but it's long. 500 feet up.
there's a ramp with a bunch of switchbacks, a lot of collapsed & rotted sections,
first 100 feet are gone but there are vines.

eridian just decides to climb, and everybody else follows except lureene.
    alatu rides molly piggyback. dennis rides panther!eridian.
    eridian drops down paper and pen. they land in a puddle.
    lureene attempts to do a note, wringing out the paper.
    creed falls on his ass. lmao.

the climbers are having trouble. the ramp is very precarious!
they are gonna fall and fuckin DIE, lureene is convinced.

melvin returns with the note... with a talon print on it.
lureene realizes, dismayed, that maybe they don't read Common.
she sends melvin back up and directs him to find someone dressed fancy
    (who she figures is the most likely to be able to read it.)

meanwhile, at the bottom, creed remembers he has pitons and grappling hooks.
    but he's the only one who does...
    until lureene remembers "oh wait so do i."
        fuuuuuuuuuuck.

second time, melvin comes back with a jewel.
    "you didn't steal this did you?"
lureene scrawls a panicked note to eridian "they can't read common i don't know what to do"

melvin delivers it to eridian. eridian Speaks With Animals to melvin.
    melvin confirms the aarakocra he saw couldn't read the note.
    (also the second one gave him the jewel as a present.)

meanwhle, eridian also remembers she can cast Spider Climb.
    she casts it on Alatu.
Molly is hella exhausted, so she'll just wait here, in one of these empty cliff dwellings.
(Dennis and Melvin wait with her.)

eridian and alatu climb up to the large symbol building.
they reach the arched entrance.
there's nobody waiting for them, but there are signs of habitation in this building
(and in some of the buildings below.)

also there's an aarakocra inside the big building, praying at the altar.
alatu calls out in multiple languages.
    to be respectful, she takes off her shoes.
the poor aarakocra (who doesn't wear shoes anyway) is confused as fuck!
    there's a panther and a very filthy human!
    what the fuck.

Alatu: "um... Nefer?" (i.e. asking "where is Nefer.")
the guy recognizes the name, relaxes, points to the east.
    (and flees once the panther is past.)

meanwhile, Creed and Lureene start climbing, what with all their pitons.
Creed falls again, before he even gets to the first one.
lureene ribs him about that.

alatu and cat!eridian find nefer!
nefer is startled and drops the plate he's washing,
but eridian lunges and catches it in her mouth.

Nefer is pleased to see them but says it's against the rules for the aarakocra to help.
You have to climb up in order to prove yourself, you see.
    But you can help each other, that's fine.
Speak to Teacher. (Their name is Ashara though.)
Alatu snapped at Nefer a bit but she apologizes after.


Creed and Lureene keep jumping across. they are not great at jumping.
they both keep missing it and having to climb the rope.
    "good thing nobody can see us sucking at this."
    "yeah i'll never tell anyone if you won't."
meanwhile, Eridian is climbing down the cliff face and sees *EVERYTHING.*

Eridian reaches molly and dennis and melvin.

lureene falls through a rotting board!
the ramp there caves away.
she catches herself but it's a near thing.
they then anchor themselves, piton themselves across carefully.

they regroup with molly.
    Eridian has been up and come back down, just told Molly to stay.

Eridian takes Dennis up to meet Nefer.
they are surprised that Dennis (a goblin) isn't Bad,
but are happy to have his help.

we continue onward.
poking heads into buildings.
it's a home.
the person inside speaks some common
and offers us lunch!
Creed is a hungry boi and Lureene's exhausted, so they take them up on the offer.
(it's vegetables!)

meanwhile, in the kitchen, suddenly everyone is rushing to bring tomatoes to places!
Nefer says to take them to the statue (since they can't fly.)
Alatu knows where the statue is (though she's reluctant to mess with the rickety stairs).

eridian sees folks frantically handing out tomatoes to everybody. asks what that's about.
"we pray," somebody explains. "tomato... offered!"

somebody runs in with a tomato for our host...
"almost time," they say.
then there's a huge bell, and at that moment,
the aarakocra all dust off the ground, kneel, and smash the tomatoes into their foreheads.

there's a peal of laughter from way up high.
eridian asks about it:
aarakocra: "princess no understand. princess mocks onmari. doesn't follow ritual."
explains that this is their prayer, to "all deity." (or "all-deity"?)
tomato is important, because teacher said so.

eridian asks to be led to ashara.
the aarakocra will lead her to "clean-house or house-house?"
they go to "clean-house" which i guess is a washing up room.
    molly & alatu go to eridian.
"dance of the seven winds" -> eridian's guide (Nando) says.
that's what we'll need to learn.

lureene tries to jump the last gap.
hammering pitons into... a wall... draws attention!
creed makes the jump on the first try.
lureene tries twice, and fails spectacularly twice before accepting creed's help to cross this ... 5 foot gap.
the aarakocra clap and cheer that she did this simple thing!
lureene is beet red for like the next half an hour.
    for this, she acquires the nickname "tomato," probably.

Nando takes them thru a dojo - martial training.
points to teacher's "house-house."
the gem (is a ring and) turns out to be Nando's, but he doesn't want it back, it was a present for Melvin. so, melvin gets a nice ring. only it's a bangle for him, lol.

creed and lureene kinda gradually make their way upward looking for their party.
creed can be the one to ask.
lureene is mortally embarrassed. to cheer her up creed offers some jerky.
    (since we just had salad.)

soon we find nefer, cleaning up splattered tomato with dennis.
where are our friends? "see teacher - house-house. much up."
creed: "who are you praying TO?"
nefer: confused. "everything...?"
so we head upward looking for "teacher" and our friends.

eridian & co reach "house-house."
    pass a place where someone is laughing and going "they actually DID it! did you see that?"
    (that'll be the princess i guess...)
just then, they remember they've ditched half their party.

eridian heads down.
eavesdrops on the house. "after all these years, can you believe they still do it?"

they meet in the shrine, talk, get shushed.
lureene is super interested in the sparring.
    distracts one of the sparrers by accident, he gets smacked in the face.

OKAY WE'RE HERE. FINALLY.
molly goes first and finds there is a giant hole in the floor!
but also an aarakocra guard who's much more fluent in common.
    molly gives her *full* name (all 30 names)
    says nefer offered that they can learn dance of the seven winds from teacher ashara.
    (not "master", the guard says.)
but to see teacher, we have to jump this hole....
    *not another one!*
well, everybody makes it, and alatu sticks the landing (and manages not to look as scared as she is.)
lureene is so embarrased and tired she just doesn't care anymore.

in this same room
there's a statue that's a depiction of ubtao as a tabaxi.
mathematical symbols on the walls with flowers.
    lots of angles and vectors, but it's hard to say what they're for.
also a mattress that's been embellished to be kinda like a nest.

next time: we meet Teacher!
