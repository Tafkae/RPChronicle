# Day 69

The party wakes up with one less member.
They head downstairs back into the city.

Goal: Go back toward 20, find Mwaxanare.
But also check out some points of interest in case of temples.

## Building 2

A walled compound with smoke rising from it. 
30 charred humanoid corpses, in red robes, litter the courtyard.
A stray dog is eating one.
    Creed and Lureene shoo the dog away.

There's a charred pole in the middle, with a bunch of firewood at the bottom.
Looks like a burning-at-the-stake setup?
Investigation:
    The pole is actually a glaive driven into the pyre.
    Snake skulls, inhuman vertebrae among the ashes.
    Symbol of Dendar the Night Serpent in ash on the wall.
        (A coiled serpent with an orb in its jaws.)
Could be yuan-ti skulls. A pile of them with the glaive shoved through it.
The humanoid corpses have clasp of a star-sunburst with red dots around it.
    Lureene recognizes it as the Red Wizards of Thay. (They're bad guys.)
        Slavers, experimenters, magocrats.

Also here: a very detailed statue up against the wall, very out of place.
Looks like a person who's been turned to stone. But they're not touching anything.
    They appear to be in a defensive stance.
Lureene pokes it and it unsolidifies.

It's a yuan-ti pureblood, male.
    He claims he witnessed this scene.
    He found a book and he thinks it made him possessed?
    So now he doesn't want to do bad things anymore.
**Karnassus** is his name.
    Creed explains we're on a holy quest.
        His Divine Sense *does* seem to confirm Carnassus is good.
    Carnassus feels *compelled* to join us.
    He says he sees his "possession" as a net positive, though he didn't like it at first.

Meanwhile, there appears to be a survivor among the wizards!
He's wearing a red robe.
Introduces himself as Orvex Ocrammas, a scribe for the Red Wizards.
He says there's 4 more of his group who appear to have escaped.

Lureene: What are the Red Wizards of Thay doing in Omu?
Orvex: We're here for the Soulmonger. It would allow us to accomplish lots of our goals.
Creed: Which are?
Orvex: I don't know really.
Creed: Our friends are lost, we're trying to find them.
Lureene: Have you seen them?
Orvex: Nope. And they're probably fucked.
Creed: Well, we'll see about that.
Orvex: Thanks for saving my life, I'm not really into this whole adventuring thing. I know how you paladins get.
Creed: How'd you know I'm a paladin?
Orvex: I'm very observant.
Molly: What do you observe about Karnassus?
Orvex: He's... touched by some otherworldly power.
Karnassus: That'd be the possession, yeah.

What should we do about him?

Orvex: Well I don't care about your kids. If you WERE after the Soulmonger it'd be different.
Lureene: What do YOU know about the Soulmonger?
Molly: Whatever we're just here for the kids!
Orvex: Can I have an escort out of town?
Creed: It'll cost you. Information.
Lureene thinks we should take him up on it.

So we head back to 1 with him.

soulmonger is the source of the deathplague all right.
it's created by acererak, and feeds one of his monstrous creations.
the soulmonger pulls their souls to it, throughout the entire world.
    it's been growing stronger over the past month.
acererak isn't here.
but the creation is down in the dungeon.
    it's tough to get down there.
    the entrance is in area 14, a tomb of the nine gods.
    is there anything actually entombed there?
        idk, maybe? they're small gods if so.
Orvex says the wizards HAVE found one of the cubes just recently.
    which one? Nangnang's shrine (18). animal: grung (frog dudes).
where are they now?
    i dunno, this was our base camp.
can your journals help?
    nope, they burned with my whole pack.

lureene says "if we find the other guys we'll try to send them your way."
provided they don't try to kill us.
    Valindra Shadowmantle is our leader. She may still be alive?
    Tell her you've spoken to Orvex and he'll be at the Heart of Ubtao.
any tips?
    avoid the yuan-ti. don't go to the palace.
any directions?
    kubazan shrine (3) is interesting... there's a moat, but be careful of the water.
        a froghemoth lives in there. wizards are avoiding.
    shagambi shrine (4) appears to be trial by combat, vs 4 statues.
        but there's gotta be some other way...
        shagambi: trickster god in conflict with Nangnang.
    the writing in the shrines is hints for the puzzles.

Orvex: waaaaait are you guys here for the soulmonger?
lureene: UMM we're here for treasure and glory!
Orvex: well the soulmonger IS the greatest treasure. if you're after that, i want to behold it! i'll help you solve the puzzles and everything.
creed: what if people were seeking to DESTROY it? (gets up in his personal space)
Orvex: uhhhhhh. well uh, it's not my place to decide its fate. i just wanna discover the secrets.
creed: hmm. it seems our goals are aligned, ish. but i don't trust your motives.
Orvex: well... it would suck to destroy it. but i'd like to see it, anyway. and you did save my life.
creed: you're not gonna sell us out to the red wizards, are you?
Orvex: no no, i'll vouch for you.

Lureene takes aside the others. Should we take him along?
General opinion: Yeah, he could be useful. Same with Karnassus.
    But we should test them somehow.
    Alatu: A blood ritual!
    Lureene: No.

Molly tells them they need to prove their intentions to us.
Orvex: How are our intentions revealed?
Molly: We'll perform a bonding ritual... (This will be performed with dream tincture, but she doesn't tell them that's what it is.)

Alatu is like, can I go buck wild?
    (which means testing them with a drug that's basically a truth serum,
    and by rubbing them in shit to see if their CON is high enough to roll with us.)
Molly says yeah sure go for it.

Alatu: So with this ritual, we promise we won't harm you, and you promise you are telling the truth.
Orvex inspects the tincture first.

Alatu minorly stabs Orvex in the chest with a weird claw, then administers the tincture with a spoon or something. Karnassus (knowing you're full of shit) allows her to do the same to him 'cause he doesn't want to hurt Alatu's feelings, kinda playing up how much he's agreeing.

The tincture is *real* bitter. So... now we wait.

Orvex goes *pop* out of existence.
Alatu, confused, takes some of the tincture as well. Crit fails her con save and goes *pop* as well.
Wait why didn't Karnassus disappear?
    Karnassus: Drugs don't affect me. I figured I'd play along to make you feel better though.

So I guess we'd better ... wait for them to come back?
And Alatu's gonna know you weren't there.
    Lol yeah good luck explaining that to her.
    Lureene: Oh yeah she's suuuuuper open minded and easy to explain things to.


## The Vision

Alatu sees Molly and Ras Nsi getting married.
    Mwaxanare is the flower girl or a bridesmaid, apparently.
But Orvex rushes in like "we found all the cubes!"
Alatu hears a voice of a trickster god asking her to help it escape another one.
Orvex says "no, you have to resist! they're tricky!"
Alatu sees a cylindrical blue object, attached to the Most Grotesque.
    She's disgusted by the Grotesque, but fascinated by the cylinder.
    All the secrets of death and undeath are within that cylinder...
    Alatu moves toward it.
    Hordes and hordes of undead souls emerge, and push your party members into the lava. They're all dead.
    You're able to hold onto the souls and stay on the path...

## Meanwhile

Then Alatu and Orvex reappear.
Karnassus: O-ohh, hey, you're - we're baaack!
Alatu: DID YOU SEE IT?
Orvex: That was the Soulmonger... it was *beautiful.*

Alatu: We also saw Ras Nsi and Molly getting married! Molly, you can do better.
Molly: I mean, I've been betrothed since I was 7.
Lureene: What does the tincture show you? The future, the past...?
Creed: /SHRUG

Anyway, **ORVEX AND KARNASSUS JOIN THE PARTY**.

## Building 4

Orvex says this is Shagambi's shrine.
It's gladatorial combat, which wizards ain't great at.
    Creed: Don't worry guys I got this.
    Lureene: Uh, *no*, I also want in!

Monoliths by the entrance: a jaguar with 6 snakes sprouting from its shoulders.
Orvex excitedly runs up to translate the inscriptions.
    "Shagambi teaches us to fight evil with honor!"
Reliefs below them depict Shagambi training warriors with swords and spears.

A huge stone door...
Orvex says: When you enter the pit, 4 gladiator statues appear and begin combat.

Creed attempts to open the door but it's too heavy.
    Suddenly, a wild initiative roll appears!
A jaguar with snakes coming out of its shoulders rushes at Creed and attacks.
    HEY THAT'S THE THING FROM THE MONOLITHS!
Another one attacks Lureene, knocking her prone.

Creed gets knocked unconscious right after the surprise round.
Luckily, Karnassus appears to be a Cleric!

Alatu hears kittens, though! Oh nooooo
The party tries to back off, to disable the animals and get past rather than kill them and orphan their young.
    Alatu blinds one with a spell; Lureene tries on the other but it fails.
    Then that one snakebites her pretty fuckin hard and it hurts!
    But Karnassus heals her a little.

As we try to withdraw, one of the cats exhales a sleep gas. Alatu and Molly fall asleep, but Karnassus and Lureene are okay. The other one breathes on Creed but he's fine.
Karnassus drags Alatu away & Lureene drags Molly.
But both of them wake up as soon as they're disturbed.

The party backs up to the road, away from the temple.

Orvex: Interesting. These were not here last time. They seem to be appeased by your offering.
Lureene: Are we gonna have to give animals food *every* time??

# Next Time On Game Grumps

* What now?
* Well, Karnassus *can* ritual cast Speak With Animals, so that's a thing.
