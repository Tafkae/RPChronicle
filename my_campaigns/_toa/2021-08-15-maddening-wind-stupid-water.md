# Day 76

## Hallway

The party slept in the hallway. Creed slept in a bit because he was tired from doing all those spells.
Alatu woke up and fucked off in Molly's direction.
Lureene did not attempt to stop her, but remained with Creed and Orvex and the Skelebros and Karnassus's putrefying legs.

## The Wind Tunnel

The hallway south led into a 60-foot drop.
Nearby was a balcony where a lever could be seen.
On a balcony at the far end of the room stood a rough-hewn wood statue, 15' tall, of a fiend with curled wings and clenched fists.

Molly, who had a climb speed, carried Alatu over there and they tied a rope to the lever.
Then they climbed down to the bottom and pulled the lever.

With the sound of grinding mechanisms, a great wind filled the chamber.
Alatu and Molly had the sense blown out of them for a bit, and went catatonic for like eight minutes.
But at the same time, the fiend's fists opened, revealing **two shining orbs**...

Lureene, hearing this, crawled down the tunnel to the drop.
She could see the two of them, just standing around... it was weird and she didn't know what to do, so she started trying to wake up Creed.

After eight minutes, Alatu and Molly decided to just walk against the wind, which was blowing from east to west. It was slow going, but they made progress.
- 5 minutes: Alatu was overcome by uncontrollable weeping. Molly was overcome by fear of the statue and ran all the way back to the west end of the room.
- 8 minutes: Alatu became stunned. Molly got confused and whacked herself in the face with her hammer.

Lureene returned to take stock of the situation, but couldn't get Molly's attention until her mind cleared.
Molly explained that they were going east to get at the orbs.
Lureene: "Uh, okay... just be-" *(careful? this is Molly and Alatu.)* "- be yourselves."
She kept an eye on them.

- 8 minutes: Alatu and Molly were both stunned.

Creed finally woke up and Lureene filled him in on the situation.
"... to get these glowing orbs, which *hopefully* won't kill us all?"
Creed couldn't get past her in the cramped crawlspace, so he just kinda ... waited.

- Alatu started babbling for 10 minutes.
- Molly became afraid of Alatu and the statue for 5 minutes, and ran halfway back.

Creed suggested using a grappling hook to get to the balcony, because maybe turning off the lever would turn off the wind.
Lureene agreed and tossed it over. It seemed to be secure, so she let herself drop, intending to pull herself up... but she rolled a nat 1 on her best skill, and the hook came loose and dropped her into the pit. She took a lot of damage. Then the wind confused her for 5 minutes and she smacked herself with her mace.

Creed attempted to use his halberd to hit the lever, but critically missed and dropped it, narrowly missing Lureene.

Molly fell unconscious!
Still babbling uncontrollably, Alatu went to Molly's aid.

Coming to her senses, Lureene noticed the halberd - "Hey, be careful! I don't have a helmet!"
She snagged the other rope with it and tried to get it into Creed's reach, but he couldn't reach.
He told her to wait, and then vanished. Turns out Creed's known Misty Step this whole time!

> Lisa: "Uhh, wait, is that a teleport?"
> Jason: "Yeah."
> Lisa: "Remember what happens when you teleport in this dungeon??"
> Jason: "I do now..."

But it went off without a hitch, and he reappeared on the balcony, exactly as intended.
He turned off the wind, and all its effects dissipated.

Grabbing the other rope, he helped Lureene pull herself up.

Molly carried Alatu up to the balcony. She took an axe and tried to chop the statue's hand off, but the head of her axe shattered into a million pieces.
So, Creed flipped the switch so its hands would open up again.

Molly - 1" diameter pearly white crystal eyeball
Alatu - 1" diameter red crystal eyeball

Molly saw hallucinations of eyeballs coming out of everywhere.
Lureene was stunned.
Alatu was paralyzed by thoughts of doom and despair.
Creed was overcome with the urge to eat something. Something strange... like the *purple mold right in front of him.* Fortunately, he managed to stave off the urge just as he began reaching for it. The little eyeballs peeked out of it like "what are you doin'?"

Creed flipped the lever off, and all the mind-altering effects stopped.

Lureene: "Did you get it?"
Molly: "Yeah, we did! I dunno what it does."

Molly and Alatu returned to the western balcony.
They examined the eyeballs, but both appeared to be mundane.

A stairwell rose to the west... but it appeared to lead to a dead end?
Creed and Molly checked for traps, but couldn't find anything.
Lureene climbed up to the landing and checked for secret doors, but also couldn't find anything. So, she gave up.

The party decided to climb down into the pit and then up to the other side via rope, with Molly climbing the wall to move the rope over. Then Molly returned to get Orvex and the skeletons. Everyone reconvened on the eastern balcony, where a crawlspace led east...

## The Closet of Niceness

Lureene, having darkvision, led the way through the crawlspace. It curved north and then into a tiny little room, where... the air was suddenly less oppressive. Like, a great weight felt lifted off her shoulders. She relayed this finding to the others, who followed her in.
Creed, with his Divine Scents, noted that it was indeed devoid of the evil aura that infested the rest of the tomb.
They decided this was probably a pretty safe place to rest (and spend hit dice).

Reexamining the eyeballs, they still seemed totally mundane.
Creed reexamined some loot he'd picked up at the Yuan-ti fortress - a hand mirror and a headdress from the slavemaster (see 02/14/21). Neither of them were magical.

## Waterfall Room: South

The floor was coated with still water.
On the walls: Murals of animal-headed humanoids with real weapons, mirrored on both sides of the hallway.
The weapons were mounted with hooks.
From closest to the door to furthest:
- Frog-headed females with tridents.
- Goat-headed males with sickles.
- Hawk-headed females, unarmed. (There aren't even hooks.)
- Panther-headed males with blowguns.
- Lizard-headed females with maces.
- Stork-headed males holding hand-axes.

**Exits:**
North, through a curtain of water, into a similar hallway.
West, hallway full of death mold.

Lureene approached the curtain and looked through. The mural appeared to be identical on the other side.
She threw a rock through, and it emerged on the other side normally.
Putting a rain-catcher tarp over her head, Molly tried to go through.
As soon as she entered the curtain, a huge wave of water knocked them all backward!

Alatu realized the west hallway led back to the atrium, they'd been here before.
Lureene theorized that this led to the *back* way into the Alatu Death Room.

Orvex recalled Acererak's hint:
> Walk through water with weapon in hand.

Lureene guessed that it was based on the order you go through, so Molly grabbed a trident and went through. Success!!
So, Creed gave it a try with the sickle - and was knocked back. Well, what the hell??

Lureene thought it might be related to the gods whose artifacts they have, so she tried the hand-axe. She was knocked back.

Alatu suggested that maybe it was the trident, since that's aquatic-themed? So what the hell, Lureene tried that next. It worked!
Everybody else got through using the same method, except Orvex, who decided to wait in the safe closet.
There were only two tridents on each side, but they handed them back through as needed. Lureene suggested resetting the tridents in case they had to come back that way. Molly wouldn't give hers back, though, so they left it with one trident on the north side of the waterfall and two on the south side.

## Waterfall Room: North

Identical murals, just in the other direction.

**Exits:**
- Northwest: hallway
- Northeast: crawlspace
