*Our heroes remember that they're supposed to be finding some children*

---

Creed feels a tug on his backpack and drops it, but once again finds nothing. He tells the party this has happened several times and is starting to freak him out. Molly offers to trade packs so they can narrow down whether it's the pack or him.

Reexamining their mission, the party decides to check out the palace complex (20). The main entrance is 20a. Karnassus says there's a secret tunnel entrance somewhere, but he doesn't know where exactly. The Yuan-ti are all over the place in there... if we're headed into probable combat, we'd better rest up, but we're going to scout out the place first. Alatu sends Melvin the flying monkey to scout from overhead while Karnassus ritual casts Speak With Animals.

# Building 20

## Melvin's Report

Three big snakes by the (nearest) door. The wall is crumbling (he points in a direction, to the left of the structure). In the complex there are tons and tons of snakes; some of them have legs, and the biggest ones have arms. By the crumbling part of the wall, there's no guards.

(Melvin holds out his hand. He accepts payment in gold and food. ~~Fuck you, pay me.~~)

## Breach in the Wall

The wall here is collapsed, but there's no stones on the ground from it happening. Lureene climbs the wall trying to see what's up, see the inside for herself. It looks like there are 3 yuan-ti guards at the north and south gates, but no guards at the collapsed area.

Creed asks whether magic was involved in removing the stones. Lureene can come up with several things that would cause stones to disappear, but they'd leave cleaner edges; more likely it collapsed or was knocked down, but the stone has since been cleared. Karnassus mentions that the yuan-ti have been expanding their underground complex, so it makes sense they took the stone.

# Taking a Break

The party makes camp, deciding to rest up and enter the compound under cover of darkness. Lureene finds a suitable building, but it turns out to have some vegepygmies inside; she kills two, and the others flee through holes in the wall, which she tries to plug up with mud. (She sends Dennis to go grab Alatu; Alatu arrives after the fight is over, but suggests mixing termite spit with the mud to make a better mortar.)

Creed and Molly search some nearby abandoned buildings for resources or supplies. Creed finds a jar of **Keoghtom's Ointment**:

> *Restorative Ointment*  
> *Wondrous item, uncommon*
> 
> This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.
> 
> As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.

Molly found dirt.

In another building, Creed found 4x Wildroot:

> Wildroot: Introducing the juice of a wildroot into a poisoned creature's bloodstream (for example, by rubbing it on an open wound) rids the creature of the poisoned condition. Once used in this way, a wildroot loses this property.

Foraging:
* Creed doesn't catch any fish.
* Karnassus finds enough food for everyone to add a ration.

---

After the rest, Creed feels someone *yank* on his pack (which is Molly's pack). Karnassus asks what's happening, and it comes out that Creed is haunted. This being a sort of *curse*, Karnassus says "oh why didn't you say so" and casts Remove Curse on him. (Creed and Molly switch bags back.)

They then proceed toward the breach. Molly feels a tug on her pack! ... But it's just a vine. \[laughtrack plays\]

# Infiltrating Building 20

The party proceeds through the cleft and goes sneaking around. A yuan-ti patrol approaches with torches, but the party manages to hide in time, inside a mostly-collapsed building that's mega overgrown. And what do you know... Karnassus finds a rough-hewn passage leading down.

## Going Down

The passage goes down about 30 feet before leveling out into a tunnel. The tunnel leads to an underground river with a couple of rowboats tied up. It's guarded by at least one Yuan-ti Broodguard. Karnassus says there are definitely more. Lureene sneaks up and attacks it with her new cantrip, Booming Blade!

It turns out there are four of them. They drop the first one, but two more come up to hold them off while the fourth takes off. Molly runs after it and catches up, slashing at it with Bookmark.

When the party drops the second Broodguard, the third makes a run for it. Creed pursues and skewers it like a goddamn lizard kebab.

Karnassus, also pursuing, pats Lureene on the shoulder and casts Cure Wounds. "You did a good job."  
Lureene: "Oh, uh, thanks...?"

> Corina: *I love how Karnassus has this Goth Mr. Rogers vibe, even though he's not really willing.*

Molly catches the last broodguard and tries to get info out of him, but he refuses and bites her neck, so we just kill him.

> Breanna: *Molly does not regret ever attempting to give an enemy an chance for life and/or freedom but damned if it never fucking works lmao. That's why she is friends with Alatu. First person she saved who appreciated it lmao*

### Underground River: Landing

Exits: West (passage), North (stone door, locked), East (river)

Lureene doesn't hear anything at the north door, but it's locked and made of stone. Creed attempts to pick it, but it's trapped and blinds him. Fortunately, he has Lesser Restoration on his amulet and undoes it.

### &rarr; West

Lureene sneaks up and notices at least three more guys at the end of the passage. Creed makes a noise that draws their attention, though, so the party attacks. As they started fighting, they heard a voice hiss in Common, "Protect the ssslavesss!"

Entering the room, Lureene sees two more Broodguards - with human hostages. As she enters, though, another Yuan-ti tries to grab her (but fails). This guy's a lot tougher - he has a human head and upper body, but a serpentine lower body in place of legs.

Snakeman steps back. "Ssstop! Or we kill the ssslaves!"
Alatu: "*You* stop, or we'll make *you* our slaves!"
S: "No one enssslavesss the Yuan-ti. We are all ssservantsss to Dendarr."

The party continues fighting, trying to free the hostages by force. They weren't quick enough to save the first two (an old woman and a young boy), but the third was unharmed. Creed cast Hold Person on the slavemaster, Molly and Alatu tied him up, and Lureene bonked him on the head to knock him unconscious.

Karnassus doesn't feel great about slaughtering his once-kin, but they're killing hostages, and the entity within tells him that's... *bad* actually. So it's fine if these guys die. He tries to Revivify the slain hostages, but... nothing happens. In this way, he learns the existence of the Death Curse.

Lureene approached the third hostage, a human woman in her 40s, and tried to comfort her. She said her name was Rachel, but she was still terrified, insisting that we've just made things worse. "As soon as Fenthaza finds out you're here - and that you've killed the slave master - we're all gonna be thrown into the blood pit and sacrificed to Dendarr!" (The young boy who died, she said, was named Koti.)

Karnassus recognizes the name Fenthaza. She's been around a while - a Nightmare Speaker (priestess of Dendarr) who *should* have been next in line as ruler. He's surprised she's still alive. Yuan-ti are longer-lived than humans, but leadership around here has a high turnover rate (and generally you leave only by dying), so apparently she hasn't taken over. Why not?

The party briefly debated how best to help Rachel. We knew the way out of the compound, so in theory we could send her back with Dennis, but there's no guarantee they'll make it. Lureene: "I don't want you to have to live like this \[in slavery\], but I don't want to send you to your death, either."

Rachel had an idea - she would hide until the slave masters came back, and claim that she was hiding through the whole fight and didn't see anything. And realistically, that probably *was* her best chance at survival for now, so the party agreed.

Lureene tried to reassure her, though. "I don't want to give you false hope," she said. "But we're here to liberate Omu. And if we succeed... we'll come back for you, Rachel."

Rachel was unconvinced. "I won't hold out hope." Then she hid in a pile of straw.

# Next time

We interrogate the slavemaster. (Creed has Zone of Truth, you see.)
