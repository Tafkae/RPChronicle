# Day 78

## Tomb of the Nine Gods, Floor 4, Maze

The party, having become trapped in the world's easiest maze, set about trying to escape. The obvious solution, of course, was for someone to lose their right arm up to the elbow, but they'd rather avoid that, for equally obvious reasons.

### Door Puzzle

Carved in relief on the door was a humanoid figure with a starry field in place of its face, holding up its right arm, which was severed at the elbow.

**Attempts**

1. *Cut off a bodak's arm and hold its corpse up to the door.*  
  No effect.

2. *Hold up the bodak's severed arm to the door.*  
  No effect.

3. *Put the Black Opal Crown back on its pedestal.*  
  The crown snapped back to a perfectly centered position. No effect otherwise.

4. *Have Eridian use* stone shape *on either the door or the adjacent walls.*
  Eridian declined, noting she could detect Abjuration magic coming from the walls. Left open as an option of last resort.

5. *Investigate the devil face on the east wall.*  
  - Creed threw a stone into the black void in its mouth. No effect - and importantly, no sound.
  - Eridian detected a Transmutation aura from it. Creed asked what that actually *meant*, as he wasn't skilled in arcane magic, and Eridian explained that Transmutation spells were generally used to *alter* matter, but sometimes also *create* or *destroy* it.
  - Inspecting the void, Lureene identified it as a *sphere of annihilation*. Anything that entered that void would *not* be coming back out.

6. ~~*Put the crown in the devil mouth.*~~  
  Decided against. One of Acererak's hints was "The maze holds the key," which implied the crown might be needed elsewhere in the dungeon. (Though in hindsight, that may have been referring to the hexagon jaw skeleton.)  
  Orvex: "*Is* this actually the maze? It's not really a *maze*, just a couple of loops..."

7. *Attune to the crown and see what it does.*  
  Lureene tried to, but quickly realized it wasn't an attunable, so she just put it back on instead.

8. *Look for secret doors.*  
  There weren't any.

9. *Remove a party member's arm.*  
  All right, I guess we're going with that. Noting that most of the party needed both arms to fight, Alatu volunteered, reasoning that she could still cast her spells one-handed - and anyway, she'd always wanted an opportunity to replace her arm with a cool undead arm, or something.

With Creed and Eridian standing by with heals, Alatu put her arm elbow deep in the devil face's void mouth. She almost blacked out from the pain, but Creed pulled her back and Laid On Hands.

As expected, her right arm was now missing from the elbow down. Looking over her new stump, Alatu noted, "I've had worse."

> Jason: "Hey, speaking of, Alatu's still *naked* for all of this, isn't she?"
> Yeah, Creed gave her the literal shirt off his back, but she lost it running through that firewall in the workshop...
> Ehhh who knows, she probably looted some mouldering robes from one of the undead corpses or something.

Alatu raised her newly amputated arm to the north door, and with a rumble of stone, both doors opened.

**YOU HAVE SOLVED THE DOOR RIDDLE!**

Just outside the door, Eridian's Druidic-speaking lizard friend was still hanging out on one of the walls. Eridian asked if he still wanted to come with them, and he agreed, riding on her shoulder.

Eridian: "You got a name, by the way?"  
*(The party chose a name at random so now he's* **Mortimer***.)*

## Floor 4, Maze &rarr; Narrow Corridor

As the party's best tunnel fighter, Creed led the way down the narrow hallway west of the maze. Since he didn't have Darkvision, Lureene followed to provide a light source, and Eridian kept an eye out for traps. Though the hallway quickly vanished into darkness, all three could see an eerie blue light from somewhere further down...

> Lisa: "That must be the tomb's nuclear reactor."

As they proceeded, the source of the light came into view. In a small room at the far end of the hall, a glowing mirror was visible. Before that, though, they encountered a side hallway leading north - back to the **Atrium**.

### Now what?

Creed pointed out that they hadn't actually *solved* the candle room yet, and proposed they take care of that before messing with the mirror. No objections.

## Floor 4, Narrow Corridor &rarr; Atrium

Remembering Orvex's comment from earlier, Lureene decided to see if there was any money inside the bases of the gargoyle statues. Short answer: there was a **LOT**. Using some leverage, Lureene and Creed pried the tops off all four pedestals. Lureene actually popped two of them off single-handed, with remarkably little effort - Creed commented on her *(somewhat alarming)* physical strength, but she chalked it up to being "stronger than she thought," much like what happened at Kir Sabal.

### The Spoils

| Statue     | cp   | sp   | gp  | pp |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | --- | -- |
| Copper     |  100 |    5 |     |    |
| Silver     |  200 |  120 |   1 |    |
| Gold       |  500 |  350 |  90 |  2 |
| Platinum   | 5000 | 7200 | 630 | 10 |
| *Subtotal* | *5800* | *7675* | *721* | *12* |

**Total value:** <!--5800 + (10x7675) + (100x721)+ (1000x12) = 166650 cp =--> **1666 gp, 5 sp**

Alatu had never been interested in wealth, so she only took 10 gp, 1 sp, 1 cp. Lureene suggested letting Orvex have some kind of share, but he declined. Lureene, Creed, and Eridian split the rest evenly, each taking 4 pp, 237 gp, 2558 sp, 1933 cp. (Value per share: 552.13 gp.)

## Floor 4, Atrium &rarr; Four Elements Room

The party proceeded to the Four Elements Room (which so far had only displayed the element of Fire). Eridian used *mage hand* to nab the extinguished candle.

Creed reasoned (correctly) that someone would actually have to *enter* the room to solve the puzzle properly, and volunteered to do it himself. He left most of his pack except for a few essentials. Eridian buffed him with *freedom of movement*, and he buffed himself with *protection from energy (fire)*, then he walked into the tiny room.

At first, nothing happened, apart from the temperature was hot. Eridian used *mage hand* again to "toss" the candle back to him (stopping it in midair just short of his hand, as a joke), and Creed returned it to its sconce.

Immediately, molten lava began dripping through the holes in the ceiling, forcing Creed to "hot-foot" around dodging it. One drop struck Creed on the shoulder, burning him, but only half as badly as it would have without the buff. Eridian re-lit the candle with *thaumaturgy*, and Creed re-snuffed it - then vanished into thin air.

## Unknown location (Vacuum Closet)

Creed abruptly found himself somewhere else - and realized he could neither see *nor breathe*. The room was pitch-dark and completely airless! He tried to light a torch, but... well, there was no air. Even staying calm, he could only hold his breath for about two minutes...

**Attempts**

1. *Grope around in the dark.*  
  Creed's hands landed on a wall, carved in relief like so many others. Feeling the contours, he deduced it was a scene of people running from strong winds and tornadoes.

2. *Climb the carvings.*  
  Ran into the ceiling.

3. *Stand in the center of the room and spin around like a tornado.*  
  No effect. ~~Sure glad I don't look stupid doing this.~~

4. *Grope around some more.*  
  This time, Creed's hands found an aarakocra skeleton loosely embedded in the wall. The individual bones could be wiggled free with a little finesse.

5. *Grope around some more.*  
  Creed found an iron sconce bearing an unlit candle. In a vacuum, this would not be much use.

6. *Pull some bones out of the skeleton.*  
  Creed pulled two bones out of the skeleton. In a flash of intuition, he realized that aarakocra bones are hollow, and therefore there must be air inside! So he cracked one open and took a breath.

> Bryan: "I'm just gonna give you this one, cause this is the stupidest thing and I would *never* have guessed it."

**YOU HAVE SOLVED THE PRECIOUS AIR RIDDLE!**

## Unknown location (Tomb of Shagambi)

Immediately upon breathing, Creed was teleported again, and could now both see and breathe!

> "I can breathe! ***I CAN FIIIIIGHT!***"

However, as he took in his new location, he realized he should probably avoid fighting if at all possible. He was in a large, cross-shaped room, where a small army of terracotta warriors stood around a central wooden sarcophagus. The sarcophagus bore the image of a kamadan (ie. those jaguars with snakes growing out of their shoulders) - which meant this was the tomb of the Omuan god *Shagambi*.

The terracotta army, numbering over forty individuals, stood tightly packed around the sarcophagus as if guarding it. The only clear path through them was liberally strewn with shards of broken pottery. Remembering one of the hints - *"the army sleeps in silence"* - Creed realized he would need to reach the sarcophagus, open it, loot it, and escape, *all without making a sound*.

- *Reach it.* Fortunately, he knew *misty step*, and had just enough range to teleport himself on top of the coffin. So that part's a piece of cake.

- *Open it.* Casting *haste* on himself, Creed did his best to ease himself down and geeeently lift the lid. At first this seemed to work, but as he opened the sarcophagus... he *heard* something. A cord snapped, a mechanism *clicked*, and then, from inside the coffin, a haunting melody began to play.  
  
  As one, the forty-odd terracotta warriors turned their heads toward Creed, and began to draw their swords. Thinking fast, Creed shoved the lid off the rest of the way, looking for the source of the music. Inside he saw the skeleton of a kamadan, a mandolin, and an ornate music box. Quickly but gently, he snapped the music box shut.  
  
  The warriors froze in place. *Phew.*

- *Loot it.* Creed retrieved 5 moonstones (50 gp ea.) and the music box (250 gp); there was also roughly 200 gp scattered around the body, but he chose to leave it behind for time's sake.  
  
  The piece de resistance, however, was the instrument. Creed knew very little about arcane magic, but even he could tell this thing was powerful. It was, in fact, a **Canaith Mandolin** - a legendary *Instrument of the Bards.* (See below.)

  As he lifted the mandolin, its strings turned into half a dozen shadowy serpents, which wrapped themselves around him. In his mind, he heard a voice purr, *"I am not your enemy..."*  

  Creed was faced with a dilemma. He didn't like the idea of allowing this trickster god to inhabit him, just on principle, but... when Molly was inhabited by Nengneng's spirit, she'd gained the ability to climb walls like a frog, even if it *had* caused a shift in her personality. And then there was Lureene, who *claimed* she still had control over her own will, but ever since she'd found Kubazan's bracers, she'd been performing feats of incredible strength - and uncharacteristic boldness...  
  
  ... Well, fuck it. They *had* to defeat Acererak, and they'd need whatever edge they could get. Creed let Shagambi in.  
  
  *"We'll make a good team,"* she purred.  
  
  *"We'd better,"* Creed thought resolutely. *"Everything depends on it."*  
  
  Shagambi did not reply.

- *Escape.* The room contained no obvious exits, but *did* contain three magical glyphs inscribed in the floor - one each to the **North**, **South** (where he came from), and **East**. Choosing at random, Creed *misty stepped* over to the north glyph and examined it. He could tell it was magic, of course, and something about it seemed *flickery*, but for all he knew that might be completely normal.  

  ... Well, fuck it. He stood on the glyph, and found himself teleported again.

**YOU HAVE SOLVED THE SLEEPY WARRIOR RIDDLE!**

## Tomb of the Nine Gods, Floor 4, Mirror Room

Creed found himself within spitting distance of where he'd started. He was standing in the small room with the glowing blue mirror, no worse for wear. Awesome! He hurried back to rejoin the rest of the party.

## Floor 4, Mirror Room &rarr; Atrium &rarr; Four Elements Room

The others were still loitering outside the Four Elements Room, waiting for him, and greeted him with a collective sigh of relief. Creed filled them in on what had happened, and pointed out that he still had one of the aarakocra bones (which, he just now realized, had a *stopper*, so he hadn't needed to break the other one). "So if you need a breath of air at any point, I've got one."

Orvex, examining the music box, determined that it lacked any magical properties or cultural significance. That's just loot.

When Creed related his finding of the sarcophagus and mandolin, Lureene asked (with some concern) whether anything had talked to him. Creed replied that the mandolin *had* spoken to him, "but I'm okay."

He volunteered no details, and Lureene didn't push for any. Some questions are, perhaps, better left unasked.

> 
> You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.
> 
> All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: *fly*, *invisibility*, *levitate*, and *protection from evil and good*.
> 
> In addition, the Canaith mandolin can be used to cast *cure wounds* (3rd level), *dispel magic*, and *protection from energy* (lightning only).
