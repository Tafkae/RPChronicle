party killed a tomb guardian (with a yellow banner on them)
    who was refilling the wine trap maybe?
went into the ring world, took a long rest
    interrupted by another tomb guardian, killed that one too.
found devlin's journal:
    raz n'si threw the yellow banner guys into the tomb without weapons etc
    they were pulled apart by tomb guardians.

tomb guardians are frankensteinian constructions, look like theyve been sewn back together.

molly is possessed by nangnang
now has an overriding trait: **"i don't share"**
didn't want to share the bag with Alatu's bones in it.

Molly was telling Creed what happened to Alatu,
showed him the bones (reluctantly),
in a bag full of wine (since Molly dunked her in it).
As they went through the ring, they realized the bag was dripping *blood*.
After a long rest, it was starting to congeal into ... a fleshy souplike homogenate, with hair and stuff.

they came back to the first dimension.
but the ring didn't work the next time they tried it.
karnassus thinks: dimension shifting takes a lot of energy.
maybe it has to recharge before it can be used again?

let's try again later if we're still alive.


# South from Atrium: Strange Door

9 feet high, made of metal, 3 oval shaped holes (2 ft diameter).
Creed looks through the hole from a distance - doesn't see anything.
Cautiously uses a hand mirror to look through the hole, can't see much.
    Room appears illuminated.

As Creed approached, something scurried and slammed into the wall - then two more - and now there were zombie heads sticking out of each of the 3 holes.

Well, this seems straightforward. Creed drew his sword to cut the first one's head off! It took a few tries.
As he struck again, he realized a chain was attached.
Lureene attacked with her Mace of Disruption. *Somehow* it made the wisdom save, which frightened it - and as it ran away, the door opened a little bit!
*OHHH,* the zombies are how you open the door!
Molly tried her Menacing Strike (unarmed) to scare the other one, but it didn't work.
The fright wore off from Lureene's attack and it came back.

Lureene attacked zombie 2 nonlethally. It went unconscious, whoops.
Molly used Menacing Attack again, which got the zombie running away - made a gap under the door - and then Molly and Lureene lifted the door up, but mostly Molly cause Lureene rolled like shit.
They lifted this thousand pound metal door until it *clicked* and stayed open.
SUCCESS!
