*Our heroes fly on down to Omu*

-----

Back while the Wind Duke audience was going on,
Molly attempted to make a harness for Dennis but failed.

Molly and Creed tripped the fuck out on dream tincture
    (which was looted from Nangalore)
    and got a shared hallucination.
They see themselves flying toward a sunken city with a river of gold / gold waterfall. They land there at the waterfall, feeling like Everything Makes Sense now, but unable to define it beyond that.

They see Eridian there and ask her what's going on.
    Eridian: "It's for your special day, Molly."

Artus Cember walks up: "I have a surprise for your special day!"
    Then he turns into some kind of horrible demon.
    Freezes Eridian into a block of ice.
    Creed attacks, but misses - his glaive bounces off Artus and hits Eridian, shattering her into a million pieces.

Then Artus kinda fades away, saying: "For you, Molly, on your special day."
    Molly realizes she's wearing a wedding dress.
    a gross snake man (Ras Nsi, though we don't know this) is being escorted up as the groom!

Creed tries to pick up the pieces of Eridian. He realizes the ice cubes aren't what he's looking for, but what *is* he looking for?
    He stands and looks around, and sees Prince Na in goblin rags, frantically carrying stuff back and forth and saying "Yes, Nare!" over and over.
    Creed: "Na, are you still playing servant to your sister?"
    Na does not hear him.

Though unarmed, Molly attacks the gross snake groom. This is a bad trip!
He moves oddly, like a puppet, with strings attached to his limbs.
Above, the sky is filled with a skeletal face. (Probably our Lich friend.)
    Molly tries to pull the strings, like, to pull down the sky demon.

As she does that, the vision shatters into a million pieces around both of them.
Then they hear, from somewhere: "I'm taking back Omu, bitches!!!"
And they're back in the kitchen coming down from their trip.

So, picking up from last time.

The party departs Kir Sabal immediately and heads southwest toward Omu.
They camp in the jungle.
Molly and Creed consult Alatu on their "vision."
    Molly wants to try again and get more prophetic information.
    Eridian analyzes the dream tincture's ingredients.
    Alatu asks for some so she can trip too.
        She's pretty sure it's a time travel spell!
        Lureene: "Time travel's not real."
        Molly: "IT MIGHT BE,"

Deeply annoyed (and transitioning from drunk to hungover), Lureene keeps watch.
Nothing happens in the night.

# Day 63

Creed confronts her in the morning.
"If you're not with us, you're against us.
If you're not gonna go along with the team,
then you might as well draw steel and end it now."

Alatu popcorns.
Molly intervenes.
Eridian puts up a "get along wind wall" around the party.

Lureene just wants someone to admit what they did was wrong.
Creed says he doesn't dwell on the past because it hurts too much.

They eventually agree:
Just because it's in the past doesn't mean it doesn't matter.
But also, they can't change the past, and have to keep moving forward.

Creed offers Lureene a dagger. Initially she thinks he's trying to force her to fight him, but he explains it's a military tradition (like real-world "challenge coins"). A sign of respect, a sign that he vouches for you.
Reluctantly, Lureene accepts the dagger.
Thus, the situation is de-escalated.

Alatu takes her aside afterwards, wanting to get the measure of her.
"Why are you here?"
Lureene: "Like I said, because it's the right thing to do.
But originally it was because I wanted to prove I was strong.
Instead I've learned how strong I'm not.
I shouldn't have fought Yingmatona, I should have stood up rather than allow the Dance.
\[Recalls the story of Camp Righteous.\]
Adventuring isn't what I thought it would be.
Adventurers just rush in and make stupid choices and hurt people.
Just because we have the *option* to do something doesn't mean we *should.*"




Molly is pissed off and sets a double speed pace for the party.

That night, they find an abandoned campsite with 2 hooded lanterns and oil. yaaay.

At the campfire:
Molly starts reminiscing with Creed about fuckups from their old adventures.
(See, adventurers have regrets too.)
Lureene listens to them. She will remember that.

Overnight:
Alatu finds a box of mead! In sealed bottles!

# Day 64

Double-speed again.
12 rations
71 bugspray

Toward the end of the day, we all see a flock of pterafolk tailing us.
They're far behind at the pace we're going, but...

That night.
Alatu: "Hey Creed, can Lureene be trusted?"
Creed: "With a secret? No. In combat? Yes. She did show up out of nowehre, and I also wonder what her intentions are. But she's proven herself as a fighter."
Alatu: "Thanks for your honesty."

Just then, three pterafolk ambush us!
Lureene protects Dennis.

As they take down the first three, another three appear!
But they're fleeing.
We pursue and shoot at them, but one gets away.

# Day 65

Normal speed, since we're Exhausted.
The airship will have arrived at Omu.

Heavy rain, poor visibility - but we manage to go the right direction anyway, thank goodness.
We find someplace to camp.

That night:
Eridian sees a bundle in the forest, but leaves it alone...
Except there's a chwinga beckoning her toward it.
Inside is 20 days' preserved rations!

---

# Day 66

Double speed! ... in the wrong direction.
Halfway through the day, Eridian realizes we're going the wrong way.
We camp in the same spot as last night.

That night: Eridian finds a backpack with 20 days' worth of insect repellent. Yaaay.
But during Creed's watch... something big approaches!
    But... he's the only one who sees it.

---

# Day 67

Double speed!
We finally make it to Omu, at sunset.
It's a huge dead city enclosed by sheer cliffs.
There's two ways in: the waterfall (NE), or stairs (SW).

Eridian points out airship wreckage at the high waterfall.
We investigate, but Mwax and Na are nowhere to be found....
