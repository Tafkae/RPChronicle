*Our heroes find Camp Righteous abandoned; they delve a trap-filled ruin in search of treasure, and nearly die, but it's worth it for a jug of infinite mayonnaise*

# Events

## Day 23

Molly was attacked by a boa constrictor.  

Party encountered three tall, cranelike birds that can talk.  
Azaka said to ignore them. Eridian identified them as Eblis, rumored to be reincarnated from evil humans - thieves and kidnappers. Sensing evil, Creed started shooting them, and the party dispatched them without much trouble (apart from Molly being Charmed). 

### Arrival at Camp Righteous

Turns out it's a forward post that was overrun by the undead; now abandoned. Camp Vengeance is the one where it's possible to resupply.

> Camp Righteous had a weird statue of a man carrying a crocodile on its back, which relates to an old folk tale. Croc carried Man across a river, and in return demanded that Man carry Croc across all the realms of Men, which is why Men and Crocodiles will never be friends.

Molly found a baby axebeak.

Lureene noticed a gap between the legs of the statue, filled with spiderwebs. Those who could sense such things realized the statue was very magical.  

### Nightfall

Creed wandered off in search of the baby axebeak. He found it, but also some goblins. The goblins got away, but the baby axebeak was reuinited with its parents. Eridian got a mask from the one goblin they killed.

Alatu caught a bunch of fish, and had Dennis cook it up into a sort of banquet. Molly tried to set out formal place settings, but did it slightly wrong, so Lureene had to fix it.

## Day 24

Lureene wanted to explore the statue before they left. However, she fell down a pit trap and everybody nearly died from the combination of that and a swinging blade trap. Fortunately, everyone managed to escape.

After a short rest, they tried again. Lureene felt horribly guilty and didn't understand why they were trying again, but everyone sort of brushed off her feelings about it, saying this is just part of adventuring. They ... didn't seem to *care* that it was her fault?

Eridian managed to bypass some of the traps by herself but couldn't grappling-hook the ceramic mug. Creed got the idea to do the whole thing piggyback, and took Lureene with him. Molly did the same, carrying Alatu. Creed and Lureene got the mug and made it back out. Molly and Alatu fucked up on the way out and got chopped in half by the swinging blades (almost).

They also found an odd Goblin Bag, a Bag of Holding that can only be picked up by goblins. So, Creed carried Dennis in to go get it. Dennis got a Goblin Bag! Lureene got an Alchemy Jug (and gave it to Dennis)!

They then spent the rest of the day licking their wounds.

*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
*Held by Dennis in the Goblin Bag*

This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

| Liquid | Max Amount |
| -- | -- |
| Acid | 8 ounces |
| Basic poison | 1/2 ounce |
| Beer | 4 gallons |
| Honey | 1 gallon |
| Mayonnaise | 2 gallons |
| Oil | 1 quart |
| Vinegar | 2 gallons |
| Water, fresh | 8 gallons |
| Water, salt | 12 gallons |
| Wine | 1 gallon |
