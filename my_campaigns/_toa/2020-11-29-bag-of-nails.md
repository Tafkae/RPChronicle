*Where are Mwaxanare and Na?*

-----

We check out the wreck.
Nobody's there, but someone finds signs that the two passengers have carried stuff out of the airship and run away. The footprints end at the cliff.
But it's the dead of night, and only half the party can see.
So we'll go to the palace in the lava pit for now, while we still have flight (till EOD tomorrow).
Creed leaves behind some paper airplanes to point out which way we went.

As we take off, Eridian hears grinding stone.
You know the gargoyle statues perched around the edge of the crater?
Yeeeeeah, at least some of them are actual gargoyles.

Eridian shared that gargoyles are resistant to physical damage, except by adamantium weapons. WELP.
We engage in midair combat!
They're resistant, but *not immune.* Hahahahaha!

So flying around got us noticed.
But Lureene notes that she didn't get attacked when she was flying by the waterfall. Maybe they couldn't hear us over the noise?
We go back and try that, and it works! We safely fly down to the floor of the place.
We then spend 3.5 hours to fly 1500 feet even though it should've taken 2.5 minutes. 'Cause fuck us I guess.

Then, Eridian (in the form of a flying spider) gets shot with a poison arrow and dropped in one hit!
Her assailant? An elderly tabaxi named Bag of Nails. The rest of the party gangs up on him, and he surrenders.
He seems to have very little short-term memory, as a result of losing his mental faculties with age. He says he's looking for a "hunter's death" - an honorable death in combat.
Creed offers him a lizard kebab, and he invites the party to his campsite. Creed keeps up the conversation, and learns that Bag of Nails was once searching for something called the "Navel of the Moon," but has since given up on that, since he couldn't find it.
He says it's a piece of the moon that will help you... find? revive? kill? do something for your loved ones.
He was looking for his son, who he "lost" long ago.

We reach Bag of Nails' camp, where he chops up the lizard kebab and tosses it into the stew before offering us all some. It's a meat stew, not great but it's edible.
Only Creed and Lureene actually eat it. (They also have some beer from the Jug of Infinite Mayonnaise.)
He seemed *weirdly eager* for everyone to eat the stew and stay the night...
But it doesn't seem to have any ill effects just yet?

Molly takes watch.
Lureene and Creed are concerned they ate poison...
    which they did!
    Eridian inspects the soup and finds traces of Midnight Tears, a magical poison that has no effect on the until the stroke of midnight, at which point it does **9d6 damage**. Yeowch!
    Fortunately, she has Lesser Restoration and we're about to do a long rest so she'll get the spell slots back.

Bag of Nails had gone to sleep at this point.
We'll deal with *him* next session...
