# Day 78

## Floor 4

The party camped out in the stairwell leading up to the **Maze**.

Just before "morning," though, a grey mist rolled in out of nowhere. Lureene and Alatu, on watch, quickly woke the others, but the party were quickly overcome, falling back unconscious - except for Orvex, who wasn't targeted, and Eridian, who resisted the effect. Eridian checked her friends' pulses and realized they were alive, but in some sort of magically induced slumber...

## Ethereal Plane

Lureene, Alatu, and Creed found themselves floating in a foggy grey void. Though she'd never been here before, Lureene quickly realized they were in the **Ethereal Plane** - a sort of liminal space that links all the other planes of existence. They could still dimly see their surroundings in the Material Plane.

Presently, a humanoid figure appeared in the mist. Drawing her weapon, Lureene called out to it. "Who goes there?!"

The figure replied, but its voice was indistinct. Creed mentioned that he couldn't sense anything from it, or from his party members, for that matter (though they could still see and hear one another).

Gradually, though, the figure resolved into that of a dragonborn, who Creed and Alatu recognized as **Zindar**. They'd met him in Port Nyanzaru, before Lureene joined the group. Zindar carried grim news, however. The party's employer, **Sindra**, was dead, and the other merchant princes were either dead or barricaded in their estates. The Port was overrun with zombies, including an *undead T-rex*. Zindar was trying to hold the survivors together, but knew they wouldn't last forever.

He and his wizard buddies had pooled their power to send the party whatever magical help they could - they'd wanted to send a *wish* spell, but hadn't been able to. Instead, they sent over some raw power (aka XP; Creed and Lureene reached level 9; Eridian didn't get any). Zindar faded as the spell reached its limit, with the parting words, "Help us, Creed, you're our only hope!"

## Material Plane, Tomb of the Nine Gods, Floor 4

The trio regained consciousness and filled in Eridian and Orvex on what had happened.

They then entered the **Maze**, once again mirroring the pose on the door to open it.

### Maze

Inside the door, a painting on the stone wall depicted crowds of people fleeing from a black star. The party wasn't sure what this meant.

Eridian asked **Lizardbro** to confirm if it was safe. Lizardbro waffled a bit, saying it was safe *as far as he knew*. (But let's be real, we're in the Tomb of the Nine Gods, nothing is safe.)

The "maze" wasn't a maze so much as a set of narrow passages that looped around on themselves. Upon entering, Creed spotted a familiar sight - a skeleton with a weird jaw! He chased it into a passage, allowing Lureene to cut it off at the other end. Lureene tried to yank its jaw plate off with her bare hands, but even a crit didn't quite do it. Creed finished the job by cutting off its head, and Lureene pocketed the **Hexagon Jaw**.

The rest of the party followed after. Orvex immediately started taking notes on the art.

Creed called Lureene over to a door he'd found in the west loop. It was open, and led into a long, narrow hallway. It was unlit, and even with Lureene's darkvision, swiftly disappeared into darkness.

Creed also mentioned a crown he'd passed in the center of the room, sitting on a small pedestal. Eridian took a closer look at this **Black Opal Crown**, and found it had a strong aura of Evocation... but she also sensed Transmutation magic coming from behind a stone wall. Following the "scent," she and Creed checked out the east loop, and discovered another one of those green devil faces set in the wall. Eridian realized the Transmuation aura was coming from *behind* the wall - which was only possible if the stone was very thin. A hollow wall!

The devil face's mouth was full of darkness and whispers, which Eridian could barely make out - *"Darkness is coming for you. Your doom is at hand."*

Lureene stayed back with Orvex (just in case), and in the meantime picked up the crown to inspect it. (As she did, the party heard stone grinding nearby, to the north and the west.) She recognized it from a relief in the Fane of the Night Serpent - this was the crown Ras N'si was after! Whether or not it could actually summon Dendarr, it was clearly *hella* valuable; she estimated she could get 5000-20000 gp for it, from the right buyer. Of course, she *would* have to be careful to keep it out of the hands of any Dendarr worshippers, and anyway this was all moot if the world ended, but...

For now she went ahead and put it on. It made her look like a badass, but didn't seem to do anything else. Returning, Eridian mentioned that the crown seemed to be magic, and Lureene suggested she'd try to attune with it later on.

Eridian used Stone Shape to melt the wall, but all they found was... a hollow in the wall. As the party discussed leaving, though, she heard skittering from the direction of the devil face, and glanced over just in time to see a mangled, disfigured corpse slither out... then another. She recognized them as **bodaks**.

> **Monster of the Week**
> 
> Bodaks are bad news. Once human followers of Orcus, the Demon God of the Undead, they're now horribly misshapen corpses that exist only to spread the blight of undeath.
> 
> *Watch out for their:* decay aura
> *Whatever you do, don't:* look directly at them

### ROLL INITIATIVE!

- Lureene opened with a *magic missile*, but could only get a bead on one of them.
- Creed cast *haste* on himself, then drew his Holy Avenger and slew one of the bodaks in two hits. Badass! But as it perished, a cloud of thick black smoke spilled out, dealing Creed a *lot* of necrotic damage. (Luckily, the cloud didn't linger.)
- Eridian became a giant spider and attacked the other bodak with her web! But since she was averting her eyes, she missed.
- The remaining bodak shambled out and made eye contact with Creed - which hurt him, but he resisted the worst of it.
- Lureene asked where she was needed, as they were in tight quarters and she wouldn't be able to land a good hit. However, Creed said he had it under control. Lureene readied a *fire bolt* in case a hostile entered her line of sight.
- Alatu hurled a *vitriolic sphere* at the bodak, burning it badly with acid.
- Creed charged toward the bodak, and Eridian gave him a boost to jump over it and land on the other side. While in the air, he unleashed an astonishing flurry of attacks and killed the creature!

### VICTORY

Lureene hadn't had the best view of Creed's aerial maneuver there, but she was tremendously impressed. "That was *awesome!*"

Just then, though, Orvex pointed out a problem. "Uh, guys? The door's closed..."

... Ah, that's what the scraping noise was. Indeed, the doors to the north and west had closed on them. On the inside surface of the door was a figure carved in relief, similar to the one on the outside, with one arm held up toward the viewer...

... only now, the arm was *severed at the elbow*.

Well, fuck.

# Next time on Butt Lumps

- Do you think it'll work if we cut an arm off a bodak and hold that up to it?
