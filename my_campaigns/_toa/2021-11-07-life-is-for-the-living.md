*Our heroes take a rest and then fuck around with some shit*

# Before long resting...

Alatu and Creed decided to take some dream tincture before they turned in for the night.

> Alatu had a weird trip, saw the Three Sisters.
> The Sisters cowered, then a huge skeletal face (wearing a crown) filled their vision.
> He boomed, *"How **dare** you invite others into my realm without my consent!"*
> Then Alatu blacked out.

> Creed had a bad trip, a lot of evil smells and blood dripping from the anatomical drawings on the wall and shit.
> The body parts in the drawings fell out onto the floor, but it was a different floor.
> Much dimmer room - two of the Sisters were there, taking the body parts and attaching an extra appendage to Creed's body!
> There was searing pain, and then Creed blacked out.
> (The sisters were Widow Groat and Peggy Deadbells. Creed recalled an old wives' tale that mentioned them, last time he went tripping.)

## Meanwhile, in the office

Alatu disappeared like normal, but Creed did *not*. Instead, he was dying! *Fuck.*
Quickly, Eridian healed him.
He woke up and found Shaggy fanning him.

Eridian told him what happened - "You didn't disappear and you started dying."
Creed: "Oh, that tracks."
Eridian: *"How does that track."*

Creed walked her through what he'd seen over the course of the adventure, in the time she wasn't with us. Also what he saw this time.
(Creed took 1 point of Exhaustion.)
Creed: "I want to take a nap."

Alatu was fine, and well-rested!
She reported that one of them was "on the outs" with the others, and they wanted Alatu to replace her.
Alatu: I mean what could go wrong?
Lureene: You'd be working for Acererak, that's what'd be wrong!
Alatu: They never specifically *said* it was for him.
Lureene: Of course they wouldn't *say* that!
Creed: Which sister was "on the outs"?
Alatu: Bag over her head.
Creed: Baggy Nana then... but the other two were the ones giving me a new appendange.
Alatu: Ooh, what's it do?
Lureene: Don't give her ideas!

Creed tried to talk her out of joining the coven.
Shaggy did too, expressing that she's more familiar with the Sisters and they'll just betray and use you and shit.


# Day 77

<!-- Lureene has 10 rations and 63 doses of bug repellant salve remaining. -->

When we ended last session, the party had taken a long rest, and a few of them had even leveled up. They'd lost one friend, but gained another. And they'd defeated the caretaker of the Tomb, who would presumably be difficult to replace.

So... now what?

## Withers' Office

They had a thought - what if the crystal necklace controls *Tomb Guardians?* They should totally check that out.

Creed tried to find the secret door at the end of the hallway but couldn't. Eridian showed him how to open it. As before, there was a Tomb Guardian there, its back turned, staring out into the hall.
Creed held out the crystal and said, "Sit."
  No reaction.
So Shaggy said it in Abyssal, and Creed repeated it...
  No reaction, except it was now looking at us.
Lureene looked it over, but couldn't figure it out.

Eridian looked it over and knew it was for controlling a specific creature.
Specifically, it was for controlling a **slaad**.
  Slaads are aberrations - specifically, shape-changers.
  They have innate magic abilities.
  This is a Slaad control gem.
  The gems are implanted into a slaad's brain at birth, and you use a paired gem to control it.
So maybe a Slaad somewhere just sat down and didn't know why.

So what to do about the tomb guardian?

Just then, they heard a bell without a source, and the tomb guardian stuck its head in the fountain.
The party decided to squeeze in there and all do the same! This is a good idea definitely.

> Your face doesn't hit water. It feels like you're looking down into another room - the Tomb of Papazotl, where there's a dead 
> A booming voice says: "22 needs cleanup."
> Nothing happens.
> "22 needs cleanup."

Shaggy: "On it!"
Eridian: "No."

Creed pulled out of the fountain and tried to dump the Tomb Guardian in. Success! There is now a Tomb Guardian sitting in the fountain.
This splashed water on everybody else, who mostly just got startled and pulled out.

Lureene pulled the guardian out and looked in again. She saw a room they hadn't been to yet.

> life-size golden statue of a whole mastadon, standing atop a cog.
> jeweled tusks, raised trunk as if trumpeting.
> inscriptions all around the base and walls - chultan warriors fighting in hellish landscapes (riding mastadons) vs. several types of devils.

Lureene pulled up and described what she'd seen, asking Orvex if he knew anything about it.
Orvex said yeah, it was a warrior's honor to ride one.
He didn't know anything about a hell battle, but said it was plausible.

Lureene suggested looking around the behind the scenes area more.
But first, Creed said, let's take care of our *friend* here.

- Creed tried to behead him, and *almost* got it. This stunned the Guardian.
- Lureene followed up with some mace blows trying to finish the job, but didn't knock him dead.
- Alatu cast *Chill Touch* and critted!
- Shaggy stuck her face in the fountain. Her vision went black.
  She reached her hand in and felt... the bottom of the well.
  "Ah, that was just the bottom of the well, I think."
- Eridian cast *Shillelagh* and whacked it. Good job.
- It started to go for its weapon, but was still stunned and couldn't move.
- Creed severed the Guardian's head, and the body fell into the well, inert.

Eridian opened the door leading back into the atrium, leaving it open so they could get back in easily (since Creed's bad at secret doors).

## Back downstairs

Before any further exploration, they decided to head back down the spiral stairs and pay their last respects to Molly.
They left the golden skull alone so it wouldn't be obnoxious.
