## Atrium

Lureene got washed back by a torrent of wine, catching herself on the railing with Creed's help. He'd been kind of "out of it" for a bit - the Sheer Evil in this joint overwhelms his senses someties.
He knew Karnassus and Molly had been trapped in the room, and that Lureene had gone elsewhere - so he asked where they were.

Lureene said she assumes they're dead. Drowned in the wine.
Creed pointed out that if that were true, wouldn't their bodies have washed out into the hall too?
Lureene wasn't convinced, but figured they should go in and try to find the bodies.

As they passed the Ring hallway, Lureene absently pointed to the south and quoted the relevant hint. "'The ring is a path to another tomb.' That's what that is."
Creed, not understanding at all: "Uhh, okay?"


## Wine Room

Wine was still pooled shallowly on the checkered floor and dripping from the mouths of the gargoyles as Lureene, Creed, and Orvex entered. Orvex immediately began sketching the tomb (he fortunately had not dropped his journal, though it *was* a little soggy with wine, like everything else).

Creed inspected the sarcophagus lid, which lay on the floor near the doorway, split in two. He noticed it was made of wood, just covered in gold paint and cheap rhinestones.
On the lid, when he put the two pieces together, it said (in Common): "Drown Your Sorrows."

The sarcophagus itself was filled with wine. There didn't appear to be anything else inside.

Lureene tried the raincatcher trick again to block the illusory sunlight.
It successfully blocked the illusory sunlight, but appeared to have no other effects.

## Meanwhile, in the Frog Room...

Karnassus and Molly dealt with loot.
    Molly's petrified egg is a **Pearl of Power**!
    That's an item that restores a spell slot!
    Soooo it would be useful to *literally anyone other than Molly.*
They also got a Potion of Supreme Healing.

Karnassus saw the slime tendril come out of the doodad and snake up Molly's arm.
It made some croaking noises and then disappeared.
He asked if she was okay, and she said she was fine, and he was like, "Okay."

Looking for a way out, they found a secret door operated by a chipped brick.
They opened it and found themselves in another room...


## Ancient Room

This room was *full* of cobwebs.
In disuse since before Acererak, probably.
To the south was an alcove with a wooden table with a dusty bottle on top.
    The bottle had a Conjuration aura.

Karnassus picked it up and dusted it off.
The bottle was clear, and inside was a tiny humanoid, waving at him and shouting in a language he didn't understand. (Terran.)
    Vaguely female, human(?), looked like she was getting angry with him.

Karnassus ritual-cast Augury. Does the Light think it's a good idea to open this bottle?
    Light: "Reply hazy, try again." (aka, not particularly good *or* bad.)
So, he opened it.

A whirlwind of sand emerged from the bottle, and before them stood a Dao.
    (That's the Earth equivalent of a Djinn.
    They come from another plane, where they're the overlords and enslave "lesser" races.)

The Dao cast a spell (Tongues) and began speaking in (what Karnassus heard as) Common. "Thank you for your assistance, mortal! I would have granted you a Wish, but you let me out for free!"
Karnassus: "Uhh, you're welcome?"
The Dao began casting another spell, a magic circle appeared on the ground, and the Dao disappeared. (Presumably back to their home plane.)
Karnassus was like "welp" and went back to the room.

With that, Karnassus and Molly returned to the Wine Room. On the way, they noticed the wine tanks had not been refilled. (The trap has been sprung and did not reset.)

## Wine Room

As he squeezed his way back out of the gargoyle mouth, Karnassus noticed Creed and Orvex and greeted them.
Lureene yelped in surprise. "You're alive?!"
Karnassus: "Last I checked."
Lureene: "Where's Molly?"
Karnassus: "Oh, she's right here."

Creed: "What did you find?"
Karnassus: "A series of disapointments."
Creed: "A dead end?"
Karnassus: "In more ways than one."

He reported, without much detail, that they had found another sarcophagus back there and retrieved an item from it. An egg, specifically.
Orvex was excited that the item was an egg, and asked which god it was, but Karnassus didn't know.

# Next time on Game Grumps

- The party is un-split!
- Maybe *now* we'll find out what it means when you get possessed by Nangnang!
- I dunno, maybe we could check out the alternate universe tomb? There might be another trickster god hiding out in there. (Or maybe it's a way to go back and get items you missed / fucked up on.)
- We probably won't, though, because nobody listens to Lureene :'D
