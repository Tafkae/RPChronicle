*The party keeps exploring.*

## Northwest Passage

The party decided to check out their  It's getting dark up ahead.

A rusty statue of a knight gripping a large iron shield.
And there's a lot of rust flakes and shards of rust surrounding it.
    Well, hey, conveniently, Lureene no longer had anything metal to lose!

Karnassus went up to Detect Magic on it, and detected a Transmutation aura on the shield.
Also, he felt his pack and everything being pulled strongly toward the statue.

Lureene and Karnassus went up toward the statue, tied off to a piton in the hallway at Creed's suggestion.

To the **north**, they saw a fountain full of transmutation magic.
Lureene suggested putting the transmutation shield in the transmutation fountain.
But first they had to get it off of there.

Karnassus and Lureene basically brute-forced it with cantrips and karate kicks, eventually snapping the shield off in two pieces.
This made the Transmutation aura dissipate, and the magnetic effect ceased.

Lureene took the two pieces of shield and dunked it in the fountain. Nothing happened.
The water seemed cool and refreshing... Lureene was tempted to drink it, but was hesitant to actually *do* so because of where they were. So Alatu did it!
Alatu promptly turned into a man.
(*Oh!* We've found the Fountain of Trans!)

She drank it again to see if it'd turn her back. Instead, she lost her voice.
Fortunately (at Orvex's suggestion), Karnassus using Lesser Restoration on her was enough to fix that part. However, 



## East: Tomb of Moa

Down a corridor to the east, a giant, moss-covered stone skull with flaming eyes keeps watch. You can make out the room behind it through its teeth.

Skulls crusted with dried blood are in niches everywhere.
There's a sarcophagus with a snake on it. (Moa.)

Behind the sarcophagus is an ornate crystal box, with a small humanoid skull floating inside of it. Looks like a child sized skull.

Moa's lesson: "Secrets hide the truth."
"Speak no truth to the doomed child."


Molly steps through the skull mouth.
One of the eye flames burns out.
    Oh... maybe they'd better save the other one to be sure she can get back out.
Lureene yelled after her, "Remember, Molly, speak no truth to the doomed child!"

Molly heard a voice in her head, belonging to a young girl.
"What's going on? Why can't I see?"
Molly replied, "Probably 'cause you're dead."
The skull freaked out. "Dead?? *DEAD?!*"

The crystal box exploded, and the baby skull started flying with green flame in its eyes. ROLL INITIATIVE.
GOD DAMN IT MOLLY, YOU **IMMEDIATELY** TOLD IT THE TRUTH,
- So it's Molly vs. a floating skull with green flame eyes!
- Everybody tried to help, but it was difficult to shoot through the stone skull mouth.
- Creed managed to hit the skull with a crossbow bolt, but the bolt disintegrated.
- Molly heard some kind of skittering... these turned out to be swarms of tarantula-sized undead spiders! WELP.
  (They look like shed exoskeletons, probably! Cool.)
- Alatu re-summoned her snake familiar and it slithered on in. We elect to ignore the actual casting time I guess.
- When Molly (predictably) went down, Lureene and Creed slipped through the skull mouth at the same time, causing its other eye to burn out. Lureene attempted to lie to the flaming skull but it didn't notice.
- Creed smote a swarm of spiders and the flaming skull. Like, in one hit each.
- Karnassus slung spells through the gap, and Alatu delivered them via her snek.

Molly woke up with healing, and Lureene said "I told you so." Then offered her a hand up.
Molly pointedly did not take her hand.

Molly kicked open the sarcophagus. There were some bones, and also a staff.
Creed used Divine Sense and the staff seemed to be Good, so Molly grabbed it.
Molly heard the staff speak in her mind... "Let me help you! I promise I'll be good..."
Molly laughed and tried to break the staff. She managed to crack it and it stopped talking.
    Oh wait, this is a god of deception...
    Orvex corrects her: "Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie."
Lureene tried to stop Molly, but whatever damage was done was done.

Welp, we do have to destroy the undead...
Lureene attacked the bones in the sarcophagus and they crumbled without even trying to reanimate. Huh.
Molly used her frost breath to get the remaining undead spiders in all their little nooks and crannies.

## Short Rest

There were a lot of weird noises in this tomb.
The party could hear a lot of movement coming from the depths of the atrium...
Molly, Creed, and Alatu could hear some kind of *mechanical* equipment. Pulleys and gears etc.
    Creed: "Well, that's terrifying."
    Lureene: "At least it's not unholy shrieking."
    Creed: "Oh, I'm sure that'll come later."
    Lureene: "At least it's not unholy shrieking *yet.*"

Where to now?
Well, we still hadn't cleared the crystal window room, but we decided to head downstairs instead.

## Atrium

Proceeding down the main staircase, the party could see three levels of balconies below them. We are now in **BASEMENT 1.**

---

# Basement 1

## Balcony

At the bottom of the stairs was a plaque written in Common. Creed read it aloud:

> The ring is a path to another tomb.
> The dead abhor sunlight.
> Only a jewel can tame the frog.
> Bow as the dead god intoned.
> Into darkness descend.

Exits: **North** (to Shouty McDemon), **East**, **South** (strange door)

## Shouty McDemon

This room held a large statue of a demonic head, screaming, pointed straight upward.
    It appeared to be painted green.
    Faint, forlorn cries echoed from the black void of its gaping maw.
    Cracks in the floor and walls radiated outward from the head, as if it had burst up *through* the floor. However, the walls were also carved with images of falling people.
From the angle of approach, the party could only see a giant green chin.
Karnassus detected Evocation and Illusion from the statue.

Creed backed up and shot it with his crossbow. The bolt stuck in its chin, but nothing else happened.
Molly approached the doorway, but didn't step inside.

Our best guess: This would correspond with "Into darkness descend."

Karnassus and Molly outfitted Alatu's familiar with a glowing bowtie, and it slithered on over to the gaping maw. But it either didn't *want* to go in, or *couldn't* go in. Alatu picked him up and tried to drop him in, but he landed on a surface. But when Alatu put her (his?) hand in the mouth, it went right through. *Interesting.*

Molly would tie a rope around Alatu and lower her down. They could reuse Dennis's flight harness! That's probably safe. They tied together 200 feet of rope.
Alatu brought a lantern, and tied the glowing bowtie around their wrist.
Lureene handed Alatu the Tortoiseshell Shield so they could hear her if she cried out.

When Alatu entered the maw, it was pitch black, the light couldn't penetrate it. But she and the group could still hear each other just fine.
So they modified the plan slightly - Creed got his lantern back, and they set up a system so if we lost audio, Alatu could tug the rope to come back. They also secured her rope to a piton in the hall as a backup.

After only 10 feet, Alatu left the darkness, and found herself dangling 8 feet above the ground in another room...

## McDemon's Stomach

Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes.
There are hieroglyphs
and a gold-inlaid funeral barge on a dais.
atop the barge: a small gold sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits on it.
There were other exits also.

a skeletal dwarf was slumped in the corner, wearing a yellow turban, dusty chainmail, and a bronze shield.
there was also a skeleton just standing around, with a pentagon for a jaw. Alatu decided to befriend this guy too.

Whenever Alatu spoke, their booming voice boomed everywhere!!!
Lureene suggested they take off the shield since they could hear each other just fine, so they did.

*Anyway, this is a room Bryan hadn't prepared for us yet, so we'll call it a night and he'll read up on it for next week.*

# Next time on Game Grumps

If the DM says "There's a lot of cool stuff on this level," you should *definitely* be worried.
