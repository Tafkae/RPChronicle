# Day 72, late afternoon

The party returned to camp and checked in with their hangers-on.

Molly and Lureene checked with Mwaxanare - what is she hearing?
    Mwax said she's sort of hearing distant market chatter.
The ladies theorized that 

Creed and Alatu went to patrol the area and make sure it's safe to leave people there, and for resources. Creed found a schoolhouse, but no useful supplies.

Creed checked on how Alatu was doing re: the evil book she couldn't use. Alatu said she was disappointed that she couldn't use it, but she isn't willing to torture someone who doesn't deserve it. Creed was glad she hadn't gone full crazed necromancer. They were concerned about finding the right buyer for the book, though, since they didn't want it to be used for evil; but Creed was tentatively open to the idea of someone *studying* it to maybe learn how to counter it, or something.

In other buildings, Creed found 12 blocks of bug repellent incense. He left this with Dennis so they'd have the incense.

The party had fish for dinner; Dennis and Karnassus had an excellent catch.
It was a little bland. Dennis explained that he'd run out of spices, and wasn't familiar with local plants to know what was safe to eat. Creed suggested Na could help him.

The party took a long rest.
* Creed heard dinosaur noises far in the distance.

# Day 73

## Dawn

Molly was the first to wake up... and found Princess Mwaxanare there, staring at her, waiting for her to wake up. 
Mwax reported that the voices were *different* last night. The merchants were angry, because there weren't enough workers, as her great army went forth and culled the land of Chult. "If I wait long enough, my army's going to return. I'm sure of it."
Molly told her, "You're hearing the past." But Mwax remained convinced.
Molly consulted Alatu's spiritual expertise, and Alatu suggested consulting Orvex.

They woke Orvex and asked him A) what is it she's experiencing, and B) what exactly is so unnerving about Mwaxanare.
Orvex said the tattoos on Mwax's forehead tie her to the Omuan bloodline. The bloodline was extremely ancient and gave her strong magical ties to the city - she might have powers over the area, and/or the area might have power over *her.*
Based on her unstable behavior, he also thought she was touched by "something more divine," ie. he was afraid she might have some kind of godly connection. But he couldn't tell whether it was good or evil. And it would be hard for any outside force to *take her over.*
So she might have some weird connection with Omuan deities *and* the gods of the Wind Dukes *and* god knows what the fuck else.
Molly described some of the powers Mwax had displayed up to that point, and Orvex took notes.

**What should we actually *do* with Mwaxanare?**

The party asked her to summon her Wind Duke friend to try and get word back to Kir Sabal. Mwax was reluctant - he was mad at her for doing it last time - but agreed.
    "Oh, Amophar! I was afraid you would not come-"
    "Silence. We forbade you from coming here, and now we break our ties with you."
Molly tried to protest, but Amophar drowned out her voice with wind. "This does not concern you."
Then Mwax's summon stone shattered in her hand.

Creed convinced Na to work on a larger version of his gliders while the party was gone. Na agreed, but asked why he couldn't come with the party, since at least he'd be with people he trusted who could fight...

## So, What's the Plan?

* We need to go to the Tomb of the Nine Gods, but we don't have the damnedest idea what's inside.
* Orvex knows the Tomb was created by Acererak to house the Nine Gods after he killed them. He designed it for his sick pleasure, to lure adventurers in and capture their souls for his phylactery.
* What about the **Ghost Lantern** that the Yellow Banner adventurers had?
  The lantern is still unaccounted for. Supposedly they were after the **Eye of Zaltec**, which (as you recall) allows you to cast True Resurrection once without materials or components. (They were trying to resurrect the Moon Elf warlock within the lantern.)
* What about the civilians/royals?
  - They're marginally safer *outside* the meat grinder.
    If they come in with us, even if we survive, they might die.
    Lureene, for one, doesn't want that on her conscience.
  - Orvex wants to come along, and it's not as hard to protect *one* dude.
* What about Velindra Shadowmantle faking her own death?
  - According to Orvex, she does that all the time. She's probably back at the Red Wizards' base camp in the Heart of Ubtao, getting reinforcements. She can make the trip in about 2 days, but it might take her a while to secure backup.

They went over the plan with the civilians. Dennis is in charge.
* Rachel was fine with it, told them she'd await their safe return.
* Dennis started making plans for fixing things up.
* Na agreed he'd work on a flying machine.
* Mwax protested at first, indignant that the party was doing the dungeon *before* taking her back to Kir Sabal, but Lureene told her if they don't do this, there may not *be* a Kir Sabal.

With that, off they went.

## Building 13: Ruined Ampitheatre

This building is all spooky and de-vegetated and full of five-foot-long footprints.
You know, T-rex footprints.
The party decided to give this place a miss.

---

## Building 14: Tomb Entrance

The tomb entrance is a cleft in the northern cliff face, with a 15-foot-tall obelisk in front of the door.

There are 3 gargoyles here, watching us.
    To the naked eye, there's no way to tell a statue-gargoyle apart from a living-gargoyle. Gargoyles typically sit around in their statue form until *something specific happens* - they don't tend to attack unprovoked.
    Lureene knows you need a magic/adamantine weapon to hurt it.

So of course, Creed immediately shot one with his crossbow. Without telling the party. The bolt splintered and fell to the ground, but the gargoyle stood and spread its wings...

Creed couldn't hurt his with conventional weapons, but kept critting it with Holy Avenger, knocking its leg off in one whack.
Lureene also critted one with her mace, it was dope.
Karnassus stole two kills with Eldritch Blast.

### The Obelisk

Lureene pulls down the vines and finds a warning written in Common:

> Fear the night when the forsaken one seizes death's mantle and the seas dry up and the dead rise and I, Acererak the Eternal, reap the world of the living. Those who dare enter take heed:
> 
> The enemies oppose.
> One stands between them.
> In darkness, it hides.
> Don the mask or be seen.
> Speak no truth to the doomed child.
> The keys turn on the inside only.

### Entrance

The door is worked stone, with skulls stacked on either side.
    Karnassus noticed each skull had a hole in its mouth.
    "Well, *that's* a trap," said Lureene.

The door has 4 intersecting lines, like how you'd cut a pizza.
Each line connects two cube-shaped recesses... eight in total.
Wait, but there are nine cubes...

Orvex points out that eight of the nine gods were in opposition to one another.
* Unkh had no opposition.
* I'jin vs. Obo'laka.
* and the other 6 i guess.

Molly goes right up and puts them in the slots, opposed as they would be.
When she gets the 8 in, suddenly a door starts to close behind them!
    Thinking fast, Lureene said to throw in the Unkh cube;
    Creed instead ducked in himself, making it in before the door closed.
Well, it's up to you two now, I guess! The rest of the party couldn't hear anything from outside.

Just one problem: *Neither of them had darkvision.*
And another problem: Poison gas started spewing out of the skulls.

* Molly took out Bookmark, which had a glow effect, then put it out because "in darkness it hides." But she couldn't immediately find the answer in the darkness, so she just tried to muscle open the door, which went about as well as you'd expect.
* Creed tried to find a ninth hole, but couldn't.
* Molly tried to smash the skulls. This just made the poison gas spew out faster.
* Creed had no fuckin clue what to do. Does it need to be just *one* person in between the doors?
* Finally, Molly used Bookmark's Dimension Door ability to teleport the two of them out.

Molly was immediately ready to try again!
Lureene got upset, said "why don't we LOOK AROUND and USE OUR HEADS instead of charging in half-cocked like you always do??"
Molly: "It's worked pretty well so far!"
Lureene: "And it's a miracle you haven't gotten yourself *killed!"*
Molly: "I don't wanna just stand around doing fuck-all for half an hour."
Lureene: "Well maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you'd have something to do in that time!"

Lureene stormed down the small hallway to the east.

There were 8 bestial statues, corresponding with the 8 gods, and set up in proper opposition to each other. Each had a basin with oil. Lureene tried to light one with Fire Bolt, and it lit up briefly and then guttered out. She went back to ask for Karnassus, as there seemed to be a magical element to this...

Meanwhile, Molly had sent Karnassus back to the skull door, and he was stuffing up the skull trap with cloth. Lureene called him over anyway.
He discovered that the statues had Divination auras, and the braziers had Conjuration auras.

At this point Molly came over like, "Hey, why don't I take the cubes in here and see what happens?"
Lureene was in the way, though, blocking the narrow entrance at first. "Oh, *now* you're interested in figuring it out?" she asked sarcastically.
But Molly wouldn't give her the cubes, so she ended up stepping aside and passive-aggressively keeping her mouth shut about this door puzzle.

When Molly entered with the cubes, the braziers immediately lit up.
Molly and Karnassus found a secret door or weakened wall, and Molly busted it down and found a similar statue of Unkh. It had a necklace with an eye on it. Karnassus immediately put the necklace on and tried to attune with it but then realized it has no use outside this puzzle.
They left the hallway and Karnassus felt the necklace gently pulling him westward, toward another cleft in the rock that the party might have seen if they'd bothered to, you know, *check their surroundings* first.

**Next week:** We maybe *actually* enter the Tomb. HOPE YOU LIKE DOOR PUZZLES AND DEATH TRAPS CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL THERE IS FROM HERE.

<!--

Breanna's okay with having IC inter-party conflict *happening*, in general, but she doesn't want there to be too much of it, and she wants it to be handwaved rather than actually RP it out. (It's a "veil".)
Paul feels the same way.

My problem: Molly charging in immediately without even *trying* to assess the situation.
Breanna's problem: I don't like sitting around for a long time working on a single puzzle. At least this way something *happens*.
Jason's problem: Too many things get shouted out, and there are good ideas that get suggested but don't end up happening.
    Also: Player 1 says "Hey I wanna do this thing", and players 2-5 answer/interrupt before the GM can say anything.
Bryan: As GM, I process "I do this" immediately, whereas I don't remind people of *suggestions* because I don't want people to think "the GM suggested it, so it must be important."
    This unintentionally prioritizes quick/impulsive action over consideration.

Some ideas for solving it:

* Before charging in to do the thing, ask, "Does anyone have a problem with that?"
* Put fewer suggestions on the stack; resolve ideas with action before adding too many new ones.
* Be aware of other players; everyone encouraged to contribute, rather than the "first to the buzzer" scenario.
* Avoid shooting down ideas for meta reasons.
* If the GM is asked a question, let the GM answer it.
