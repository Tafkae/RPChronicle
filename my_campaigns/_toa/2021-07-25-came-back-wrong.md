# Day 75

## Secret Door

Behind the door was nothing but a font of water.
Karnassus reported it had a Divination aura.
Lureene looked through it, and with some green light she was drawn into a vision...

> i'm watching through someone's eyes.
> 4 sunken pedestals, a catwalk all around
> a big dinosaur, but something's wrong with it. it's walking around but looks like it should be dead.
> whatever i "am" dumps brains into the pit.
> 
> there are 3 undead near the far wall, but they seem more aware.
> they're painting on easels, scenes of pain and carnage and death.
> the southmost Artust is depicting the fall of the Company of the Yellow Banner.
> they're all dead, one who looks kind of lord-like is choking on poisonous gas...
> it's sickening.

all of a sudden, the water began to boil,
and out exploded a hulking tomb guardian in plate mail!

## Roll initiative!
 
- Lureene, being closest, cast True Strike and whacked him.
- Molly shoved her way up front trying to to get close enough to attack.
- Creed attacked at reach with his glaive.
- Alatu shoved her way in as well.
- Guardian attacked Lureene with its fists.
- Karnassus cast Guilding Bolt, next attack has advantage.
- So Lureene whacks it once but misses the second time.
- Molly shoved her way into the room, handing the skeleton leashes off to Karnassus. She attacked with Bookmark.
- Creed attacked with glaive.
- Alatu used Chill Touch! It's not very effective...
- Guardian went berserk and slammed Molly big time.
- Karnassus Eldritch Blasted him, and he fell facefirst into the well, dead.

## Out of combat

The party tended to their wounds briefly.
Lureene shared what she'd seen.
    Describing the dinosaur, 

Karnassus checked the guy for marks, but didn't find any.
They briefly suggested drinking the water, but it didn't seem like a good idea...
    Creed took a few minutes to ritual-cast Purify Food and Drink.
**Everyone has a full canteen now.**

They suggested that Alatu summon her familiar, but that would take an hour and we just got up like 10 minutes ago, so we decided she could just do it when we *do* stop for a short rest.

# Level 3

The tomb guardians in the left hallway were back! YAY.
Not wanting to fight them again right now, the party decided to try the south hallway instead.

Creed asked Alatu how the deathmold could maybe be weaponized, but she was AFK.

## South Hallway

Lureene and Karnassus had been checking this out yesterday.
Creed led the way and peered around the corner at the intersection.

to the **West:** dead end, but with the opening of a tiny crawlspace.
to the **East:** puddles of water on the floor.

We figured we should scout it out, but it seemed probably dangerous.
Rather than wait for a familiar, Molly volunteered to do it herself. Yeah, alright, whatever.
    Karnassus is kind of the reluctant skeleton-sitter for now.

## Crawlspace

Molly entered the crawlspace, using Bookmark as a light source.
To the west was a snarling minotaur in a sheet of bronze,
but its eyes had been cut out so you can look through them.
There was a little door that seemed to empty out somewhere else, but she couldn't lift the door.
    Might be a switch or something? Or was it just heavy...
Lureene gave it a go and successfully lifted the door out so it latched.
    Molly and Alatu went along.
    Creed and Karnassus and Orvex stayed behind.

It empties into a hallway. The walls slope inward as they go up, and deathmold clung to the walls and ceiling as well as the floor, but only on the east side of the hallway.
To the east was another crawlspace.
To the west, a 3-foot hole in the floor with light spilling out of it.

(Meanwhile, Creed and Karnassus discussed Alatu's odd behavior. Did she come back without a soul? With someone *else's* soul? They agreed to try and conduct a Ceremony to help her or something.
    Creed: "How do we get her to agree to it?"
    Karnassus: "We could be like 'Alatu, wanna see something cool?'"
They agreed to kinda trick her into it. Karnassus said he was willing to lie in service of the greater good.
Creed wasn't 100% comfortable with the idea, but agreed that telling it to her straight might be a bad idea.)

Lureene went over and peered down the light hole.
It was a short 15-foot shaft that dropped into a ... curved-looking room? The floor was not flat.

Molly called back their intentions through the crawlspace (but Creed and Karnassus didn't hear anything).
Then Molly entered the next crawlspace.
This one opened into another, large rectangular room.
She was in the bottom of a pit, above which hovered 5 wooden platforms connecting 2 balconies.
A single torch burned at one end.
At the other end was a 15-foot-tall statue of a fiend and a rusty switch.

Molly climbed the wall to the balcony with the lever, because having "a frog in her heart" gives her a climb speed.
She announced that she'd found a puzzle.
Alatu thought it'd be a good idea to get the boys first, so they did.
The door had closed, so Lureene opened it again.
As they went back, Creed hammered in some pitons to hopefully jam the door open.
    It didn't work at all, and the door slammed shut while Karnassus was passing through it!
    Karnassus was SEVERED NEATLY IN TWO.

Lureene delivered the bad news to Molly, who ranted about how this place sucks and she hates the undead asshole who made it and the snake asshole who runs it.

Creed wanted to try and break the trap, but Alatu was in the way.
So Creed exited the crawlspace, and then Alatu exited the crawlspace, and then Karnassus's upper body exited the crawlspace...
Oh, Alatu reanimated him.
Lureene and Creed were both very angry about this!
Alatu was like: "Look, I brought him back to life!"
Karnassus's corpse: "*Kiiiill meeeeee*"
    So Lureene shoved past Alatu and whacked Karnassus with her mace, vaporizing him.

Creed did a ceremony to try and return Alatu to her original alignment! ... But he couldn't get much of a connection, it seemed like. It failed.
    Alatu cast Find Familiar while he was doing that.
    Lureene broke the trap and went to 
So... he pretended the failure was part of the ritual, and tried to cast the whole thing over again.
It didn't work, so he tried a third time...

Alatu started mocking him, her snake familiar crawling on him, etc...
Alatu: "It's not working! See, there's nothing wrong with me. Maybe there's something wrong with *you.*"

But Creed wouldn't give up. Alatu was getting a kick out of his frustration, so she offered him *her* gold as well.
Creed accepted it, smugly. "We could be here a *while,* Alatu."
But she wouldn't back down either.

Attempt 4: fail.
Alatu took a nap.

Attempt 5: fail.
Alatu woke up, made herself annoying, distracting him.
Creed finally got fed up after this one, asked her why she was resisting so much.

Orvex contributed his opinion but I wasn't really paying attention.

Creed tried talking to Alatu, trying to get *why* she did that.
She said she just wanted to bring Karnassus back so he could be part of the party again.
Creed wasn't sure he trusted her enough to sleep near her.
    There was another spell he could prepare that might work...

> PS. Lureene got 1100 xp for slaying the Karnassus torso.
