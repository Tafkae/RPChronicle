# Events

## Day 32

rations: yes (11 remain)
bugspray: yes (80 uses remain)

they burn the hag bodies, on account of the undead curse and all.
there's a weird green smoke...

and hear faint cheering from the northeast.
most likely the goblins.
lureene gets the idea - we should tell them that we killed the hags!
just in case we run into them later, then we won't have trouble with them.
    but that would take too long.
we could leave a sign saying we did it...
    i guess we could write it in common and goblin...
    but can any of these goblins read, even?
well how about taking a trophy to prove it was us?
    uh, we burned them already, though.
maybe a bone?
    it's gonna take hours for it to burn down enough.
okay, okay. lesson learned: when you kill stuff, take trophies, THEN get rid of the bodies.

traveling down the river. around midday it opens up into a marsh.
suddenly foggy... but not like a creepy fog. 100ft visibility.
slow progress cause it's more of a muddy morass.

hey Eridian, can your Shape Water help us go faster?
    Eridian: i dunno...
    (no, that would be Control Water which is a 4th-level spell.)

we're in Aldani Basin, Azaka says it's got some ghost stories but she's never had trouble...
    Creed & Lureene: TELL US A STORY
story: lobsterfolk.
    do they exist? who knows.
    fisherfolk called the aldani (not fishfolk, fishERfolk.)
    they ate all the lobsters, so Ubtao
        Ubtao : patron god of the jungle (who fucked off cause of people)
    transformed them into monstrous lobsterfolk.
    nobody knows what they look like but they're probably GREAT dancers.

night falls.
we find a solid place to camp.
leaving the boat here and going the rest of the way on foot.
    2 days to the plateau
    won't have to rock climb, there's a path carved into the side.

good fishing in the marsh. (Alatu)
gathering in the jungle. (Eridian)
    they both get lots of food, a catfish fry with nice sides!
    add +1 ration (12) and don't consume one tomorrow.

at the end of the night...
a fell wind blows into camp.
suddenly everybody's short of breath!
    lureene and creed fail the con save.
lureene:
    do you have a lucky charm? no
    well, now molly is your lucky charm.
    you feel like you HAVE to be near molly.
    like you won't be able to accomplish anything without her.
    if you're not within 30 feet:
        you lose all confidence in yourself. you feel uncertain, unconfident.
        disadvantage on all d20s.
        (attacks, ability/skill rolls, saving throws)
    you can do another Con save in 20 hours.
creed:
    you feel like your hands are way too dirty
    and won't become clean no matter how much you wash them.

creed goes to wash his hands. (lureene gives him her soap)
molly feels like thats weird!


## Day 33

eridian detects poison and disease
identifies it as: mad monkey fever!
    detects lureene is affected too?? she's surprised.
eridian casts Lesser Restoration on both of them.
soooo they're both cured! hooray.

rations: no (12)
bugspray: yes (79)

uneventful travel. marsh goes back to more solid ground.
creed hunts, eridian forages. find rations for selves only.

night:
alatu hears wailing of large creature... creepy wind in the distance.
molly's watch uneventful.

## Day 34

rations: yes (11)
bugspray: yes (78)

today's HOT and uncloudy.
    heavy armor: take 1pt exhaustion.
Dennis hates the heat, whines all day about how he's dyyyying.
otherwise uneventful.

the plateau is in sight!

lureene sleeps out of armor (exhaustion)

creed has armor off but takes watch.
fortunately, uneventful.

## Day 35

rations: no (11)
bugspray: yes (77)

creed: will we need bugspray on the plateau?
azaka: uhhh idk? bugs don't bother with me.

reach the plateau. 1800 feet high!
carved pathway that you can climb, narrow but not uncomfortably so.
    3 miles of switchbacks, 5 feet wide.
azaka's afraid of heights..... oh well!
    she just kinda hugs the wall though.
3 hour climb.

we can see for a long way.
    east: the whole aldani basin
    southeast: the Heart of Ubtao
        a floating island, vaguely heart-shaped.

    west: a ziggurat. this is Orolunga: our destination!

arrive at ruins of Mbala, which is at the top of the path.
walls are stone, 20 feet tall.
    gates rotted, buuuut replaced with heaps of clean human skulls.
    they've all been gnawed on.
    chest high wall basically.
molly scrambles over the skulls first.
eridian goes panther and uses her climb speed.
creed eats shit on the skulls.
lureene makes it to the top but slips going down the other way.
azaka just picks up dennis and JUMPS over.
alatu takes a baby skull, soft spot and all.
    it has pronounced teeth marks on the face.

in the center of town is a statue of a robed figure holding a dagger.
the statue is OLD AF.
    lureene: is this like a human sacrifice thing?
    creed: i dunno.
    lureene: who lived here?
    azaka: i dunno.

creed scouts the second half of the village.
it's all foundations, jsut like the first half.
but at the far end, there's a hut.
    made of hides with a thatched roof, draped over a huge ribcage.
    creed: does the old lady live there?
    azaka: idk, maybe.
they pass a well. it's echo-y. has some scummy black water at the bottom.

smoke in the hut. it's occupied.
bone windchimes, etc...
we can see inside someone hunched over... it's a human woman. SUPER old.
    having trouble moving around.

molly. "ma'am?"
the woman is startled, drops her pot.
    this is the old lady azaka was talking about.

lureene: we're going to orolunga.
lady: yeah thats the only reason people come thru here.
lureene: do many of them come back?
lady: Azaka does. and this guy Artus Cimber did!
lureene: oh hey we know that guy!

lady: do you have some food? pterafolk pillage everything.
alatu: you haven't been eating BABIES?
lady: w-what? noooo

there's soemthing off about her. it seems like the pterafolk thing is bullshit.

lureene: how long have you been living here?
lady: uhhhhhh... my whole life. 92 years?
    lureene can tell she's lying.
    this place has been abandoned WAY longer than that.
creed can tell she's fuckin EVIL.

lady: before you go see saja n'vaza
    can you help with the pterafolk?

everyone: haha yeah no we gotta go. byyyyyeeeee
lady: well fuck YOUUUUUU
    i can resurrect people in spite of the death curse!

everybody leaves and alatu brings up the rear.
as we leave, alatu sees 5 flying monkeys land on her shoulders and go with her into the hut.

they decide not to go back for now, but to be extra careful on watch.
alatu tries to leave her familiar behind to observe, but the flying monkeys tear it apart. whoops.

going forward: easy terrain, can cover 2 hexes per day.
open flat terrain means no surprise encounter rolls. yay!
can still forage.

foraging tonight: eridian finds food for everyone.
also, finds a tra'thua plant!
    in a potion, it can be used to make you impervious to spider venom for 2d4 hours. monetary value: 650 gold.

night: uneventful.

next time: continuing toward orolunga!
and maybe even going inside!
