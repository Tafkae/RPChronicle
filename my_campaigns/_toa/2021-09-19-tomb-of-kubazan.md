# Day 76, 3 pm

## Horcrux room

Having rested, the party went back to grab Orvex and the skeletons.
They went ahead and took the jaws off the skeletons.
Introduced Orvex to Eridian, he was fascinated by the tales of Artus Cimber (but there's not time right this second).

## Atrium

Okay, where to next?
Do we *need* to clear every room on every floor?
- Orvex is a completionist, of course.
- Molly and Creed work out that there's only one Skele-Jaw Key on each floor. But the crystal eyes have only been on *this* floor.

Eridian gets a better look at the statues below.
On each pedestal: a stone gargoyle statue with four arms.
The top of each pedestal is a sheet of a different metal.
- North: copper
- West: platinum
- East: silver
- South: gold

## West Hallway

Two tomb guardians, chained together. Remember these guys?
Lureene filled Eridian in on the previous fight. They weren't *totally* sure, but it seemed like they shared HP while the chain was intact. (Creed was concerned it might be a higher total HP pool than they had individually, though.)

- Alatu opened with a Goreball. It's effective!
- Lureene ran up and used Booming Blade, then disengaged and moved backward.
- Creed tried his glaive, but it didn't do much, so he switched to the Holy Avenger, which worked a lot better.
- The guardian picked up his glaive and tried to use it, but immediately dropped it.
- Eridian brought back an old favorite: MOONBEAM!
- Molly readied an attack in case anybody went down.
- Alatu hit one with Ray of Enfeeblement.
- North Guardian failed his Moonlight save. Then he moved, and BOOOOM, took the Booming Blade damage! *FINALLY* got it to proc, awesome!
- Lureene started wailing on it, but couldn't land a solid hit.
- Creed landed a pretty solid hit on South Guardian though, knocking some armor bits off.
- South Guardian failed Moonlight save. Then went to try and barrel *through* Creed into Eridian! Luckily, Eridian did not get knocked over. The guardian fell prone.
- Eridian cast Shillelagh, making her quarterstaff use her magic attack/damage.
- North Guardian attacked Lureene and got her right in the gut.
- Lureene used True Strike and attacked North Guardian, dealing the final blow! It toppled over, and the chain vanished.
- Creed used the opportunity to whack South Guardian a couple times.
- Then South Guardian got up, oddly seeming reinvigorated! He began flailing, making *two* attacks *each* on Lureene and Creed! But Creed AoO'd him, so he was on his last leg.
- Molly continues readying, lol.
- Alatu whiffed her chill touch.
- Eridian's Moonbeam finished off South Guardian.

**Exits from this hallway:** North (passage to Gazebo Room), West (big doors), *South (secret passage)*

## Froghemoth Room

Up here was a sarcophagus underneath a four-posted portico/gazebo/whatever.
Four ceramic frog masks hang in niches around the sarcophagus.
    Beneath each are a bunch of humanoid bones.
To the east: a large carving of a froghemoth, lording over his shrine.
    Beneath it is a table with offerings haphazardly strewn about. Gold, candles, etc.

Four frescoes on the walls:
1. Froghemoth uses tentacles to help Omuan people.
   A woman in a frog mask casts out 5 gold as if sowing seeds.
2. Froghemoth wraps tentacles around crocodile as Omuans stab the croc.
   Old man in a frog mask holds up a bug as if to eat it.
3. Froghemoth with 4 hunters on its back, finding a lost boy in the forest.
   Old woman in a frog mask holds a knife in one hand, headless chicken in the other.
4. Froghemoth in a pool, being offered all sorts of tribute.
   Humanoid in a frog mask (fresco is damaged, can't tell which one) holds up a candle.

## Hallway by the door

Molly examined the door. It didn't seem *trapped*, but it was kinda rusty.
Molly slammed the door with her fist, to listen to what happened.
    It actually swung the door open a little bit.
    10 feet or so behind it was a tapestry (stretching from wall to wall) with an image on it, but they couldn't make out what from a quick glance.
They decided to wait until the sarcophagus was resolved.

## Okay Froghemoth room again

Lureene and Eridian entered the room. Inside, it was suddenly hot, stifling, humid.

6-inch statue of a stone froghemoth. Inscription:
> Give thanks to me, as others have done since the dawn of time.
The hint corresponding to this room was *The walls of history tell all.*

Sensing no magic in the masks, Eridian put one on and deposited 5 gold on the table.

Suddenly, they heard booming laughter, and three wraiths emerged from the walls!

- Normal weapons won't work on these, but Creed's silvered glaive hit one alright.
- Two of the wraiths made a beeline for Eridian, nearly killed her.
- Lureene attacked one, and her mace worked great! But although it was undead, it didn't disintegrate.
- The third one also made a beeline for Eridian! But missed.
- Molly exclaimed, "You *just got back,* you're not dying now!" and attacked! Her warhammer was also silvered this whole time, so it hit once.
- Alatu *would* have cast Animate Dead, only it takes a whole minute for some reason? So instead she just whiffed with Chill Touch.
- Creed attacked Wraith 3. Solid hit!
- Wraith 2 went straight for Eridian, moving *through* everything - and everyone - to do so.
- Orvex *(between screams)*: "I-I think you have to complete the ritual! Or kill them!"
  Lureene: "Por que no los dos?"
  Orvex: "Also I think I accidentally a secret door over here!"
- Wraith 1 attacked Lureene. She made the save but took some necrotic damage.
- Lureene tried to attack but whiffed because the touch was really unnerving.
- Wraith 3 attacked Molly, and pulled 23 max HP right out of her! (73 -> 50)
- Eridian summoned some critters! 3 giant spiders.
- Molly hit Wraith 3 with a hammer and destroyed it.
- Alatu started trying to complete the ritual. (Lureene: "Grab a mask!")
  She did, and then ate a cockroach.
  This resulted in laughter, and three more wraiths spawning!
- Creed realizes "Wait, we fucked up! We took someone else's offering!"
  He grabbed the mask from Eridian and tosses 5 of his own gold on the offering plate.
  Then he heard a gaspy *thaaanks* and the two of the first wraiths disappeared.
- The wraiths attacked Alatu!
- Lureene got Alatu's mask and ate a cockroach!
  This dissipated the other 3 wraiths.
  *Phew!* But also Lureene regrets everything.

Okay, let's keep going. Can we find something alive to sacrifice?
Yes - Molly finds a mouse hanging out in the corner, puts on a mask and smashes it.
    (She apologizes first.)
She puts the dead mouse on the altar. Nothing happens. (That's good, I think.)

So how do we do a candle?
We used some bug salve, put this spare wick in it, and Eridian put on the mask and lit the "candle."
The windy voice laughed. "Creative... but it'll do."

Lureene opened the sarcophagus and found a pair of bracers with froghemoths engraved on them. They began to glow with a watery texture, and *everyone* saw a froghemoth shadow rise up from the sarcophagus.
**"Hahaha! You are brave indeed to open my tomb!"** it boomed. **"Together, we will crush the Undying One!"**
Lureene glared it down. "We will - but *I'm* calling the shots."
Kubazan: *"Haaa... we will crush him."*

(Unbeknownst to anyone - including her - she failed the save, and became inhabited by Kubazan.)

# Next time on Game Grumps

- We find out what being inhabited by Kubazan is like!
- Also, what's behind that secret door Orvex accidentally opened?

---

# Kubazan

(pronounced *KOO-bah-zahn*)

Kubazan, the Froghemoth, is wild and spirited.

## Flaw

While inhabited by Kubazan, you gain the following flaw, which overrides any opposing flaw: "I am fearless and not afraid to take great risks."

## Power

While Kubazan inhabits you, your Strength score becomes 23 unless it is already higher.
