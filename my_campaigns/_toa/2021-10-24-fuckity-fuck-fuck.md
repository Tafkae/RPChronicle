*A cowardly foe is pursued; a new ally, properly introduced; a level or two, gained; and Alatu finally puts on some actual clothes again*

# Day 76; 5pm (still)

When we left our heroes, they were in the middle of combat against **Withers**, the caretaker of the dungeon.h

- Eridian suddenly realized, Withers was a Wither!
  Oh, I guess that's a creature type.
  "He's weak to sunlight!"
  Then she slapped a heal on Lureene and scrambled around on the wall.
- Shaggy cast Fog Cloud, shrouding most of the room in a thick, dense fog. Then she vanished into it, headed for the iron maiden.
- Withers, startled by the fog, attacked Creed. Creed lost some max HP.
- Lureene continued whaling on Withers. "Just! Fucking! Die!"
  Solid hits, but after he was healed by the tomb guardian, he doesn't seem affected as much.
- Alatu cast Chill Touch! It's super effective!
- The raptors, blinded, lashed out at random! But they got lucky and hit fucking everything.
- Creed continued whaling on Withers as well, reasoning that was their best chance of survival. He seemed to have gotten a massive pool of Temp HP from the Tomb Guardian.
- From the fog, combat noises could be heard! It sounded like the bad guys were hitting each other by mistake.
  And then someone yelling in Dwarvish, "Idiot, why are you hitting *me?!*"
  A couple of the dwarves managed to extricate themselves from the fog, but met the point of the Holy Avenger. Sadly, this did not kill them right away.
- Eridian cast **Daylight**, flooding the room with ... daylight!
- Shaggy reached the iron maiden (and a nearby corpse pile). The iron maiden didn't seem to be magic in and of itself; it just held the corpse parts together while someone else made the thing.
- Withers gasped, shielding his eyes from the blinding light, and attempted to flee into the fog. However, Creed and Lureene got opportunity attacks, and Creed's AoO *stops creatures from moving*. So Creed cut him off before he could escape into the fog.
  Withers grabbed a dwarf adjacent to him and absorbed its HP, too.
- Lureene yelled to Alatu to kill the other dwarf!
  Then she flanked Withers again and cast Booming Blade on him. (So if he continued trying to flee, he'd take more damage.)
- Alatu cast Chill Touch on the dwarf again. It was almost dead!
- Creed kept hitting Withers. He appeared to be on his last leg...
- More combat noises from the fog... lol dumbasses, they're still hitting each other.
- Uh-oh, it sounded like all the raptors were dead maybe...
- Eridian cast Moonbeam! (Hey cool, Daylight isn't a concentration spell!)
- Shaggy shot at the dwarves, who she could see but they couldn't see her.
- Withers touched his amulet, and... *pop!* Disappeared.
  Suddenly, a huge wall of fire appeared just to the north, cutting them off from chasing him.
- Lureene: "Fuck! I forgot he could do that!"
  She hit the dwarf one more time, killing it.
  "The fog! He's in the fog! Don't let him get away!!"
- Alatu cast Ray of Enfeeblement into the cloud, but wasn't sure whether she hit anything.
- Creed used Divine Sense, trying to spot any undead in the room/cloud.
  But he couldn't detect any undead.
  "Uh, hm. He's not undead."
  Lureene: "I coulda told you that, my mace hasn't been proccing against him."
- Eridian held an action to heal Shaggy if Shaggy became visible.
- Shaggy, hearing he was in the fog, moved to try and locate him. Then she shot him and cast Hail of Thorns, which only did like 1 extra damage, but it dropped the fog cloud.
  Withers was startled. "What?! Where did you-?!"
- Withers grabbed a tomb guardian and absorbed its HP! FUCKING SHIT, GUY.
- Alatu started killing off cronies at range.
- Creed got out his hand crossbow and began shooting cronies too.
- The two remaining dwarves trained their crossbows on Creed, but both missed.
  Creed: "Phew! Dodged a bullet there."
  Lureene: "Or a bolt, I guess."
- Shaggy called out to Withers, "Hey! Did you see what those guys were doing?!"
  And she cast Charm Person, hoping he hadn't seen her attacking him just now.
  It didn't work, so she cast Magic Weapon on her weapon and moved up to join him.
- Withers barked some orders in a language nobody understood. He turned to Shaggy, said "You, follow me!" and headed for the stairs.
- Lureene shot a Firebolt at a dwarf. It not ded.
- Alatu shot a Chill Touch and missed.
- Creed shot his crossbow and missed... and also the string fucking broke! *AGAIN!*
- The dwarves moved to the door, taking up flanking positions on either side.
  The tomb guardian moved to follow.
- Eridian stepped down from the wall. "Did you break your crossbow again, buddy?"
  Creed, deeply dejected: "Yeah... wouldn't you friggin know it??"
  Eridian cast **Mending**, fixing the crossbow string.
  Creed: *"YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT THE ENTIRE TIME?!?!"*
- Shaggy followed Withers up the stairs, then tried to pat him on the back hard enough to break his spell concentration. (ie. unarmed attack. She critted, but did minimum damage.)
  Withers *barely* made the save to keep his concentration. He coughed, but still didn't see her as an enemy.
- Lureene, frantic, grabbed the crossbow off the nearest dead dwarf and fired at the nearest living dwarf, which promptly also became dead.
- Alatu took off Creed's shirt (so she was just naked now) and started trying to beat out the flame wall. It kinda worked? She made enough of a gap to get through ... almost. But then the shirt caught fire and she got caught in the wall of flame.
  She went unconscious and fell prone in the flames. WHOOPS.
- Creed pulled her out of the fire and into the hallway, then used the magic ointment we found outside in Omu to heal her a little bit.
  Creed: "Next time don't use the *clothes*..."
- A dwarf shot at Lureene.
- Eridian moved her Moonbeam to hit the remaining mooks.
- Shaggy shouted to the mooks in Abyssal (the same language Withers was using), "Hey guys, we're coming this way! C'mon!"
  (They did not follow.)

## Expeditious Retreat

Shaggy followed Withers into a hallway, along with her animal companion Bambo. She sent Bambo to move ahead of Withers, hoping to trip him up.
Withers stopped, though. "Will you accompany me back to my office?"
Shaggy: "Uh, sure. Aren't we going the wrong way, though-"
Withers grabbed Shaggy by the shoulder and they teleported back to his office.

## Meanwhile, in the fight...

- Lureene was like "Where are you going, guys? We can't let him escape!"
  She flipped a table onto the flame wall, using the brief delay before it caught fire to get across unsinged.
- Alatu thought about following, but decided not to, and went to check out the secret door Eridian told her about. She couldn't get it open.
- Eridian followed her and showed her how to open it, with a switch. On the other side was a familiar room with a font of seeing, and... another Tomb Guardian! It had its back turned, but the door was jammed open and they couldn't close it...

## In the office

Shaggy tried to "accidentally" fall down and make a big noise. She only succeeded in making a *small* noise, but Withers seemed to believe it was accidental. "Ugh, underlings."

Withers: "We need to put the tomb into lockdown. Reset everything before these adventurers can clear another room. We may need to head outside and hit the total lockdown mechanism."
Shaggy: "Uh. Yeah. That's bad. I'm not trained on that, though, I'm still in probation..."
Withers: "Sure, sure. Just stay with me and help me do what I say."
He then began looking through his desk.

Shaggy looked through the eyes of the bone bird. It worked, but there wasn't much she could do with it.

## In the fight

- Lureene hopped the table and cast Lightning Lure! The dwarf succeeded on the Strength save, though, so this did nothing.
  Well, fuck it. She dashed over and smacked the Tomb Guardian! ... It also didn't do much o' nothing.
- Creed sheathed his sword and vaulted over the table too, attacking the dwarf with his glaive. First attack missed, second critted and took him out.
- The Tomb Guardian, now the last remaining fighter, attacked Lureene with his fists!

## Secret door

- Alatu tried to cast Friends, but it didn't work because Tomb Guardians are constructs.
  Welp, in that case, she decided to baaaack up outta there.
- Eridian also backed up.
- The Tomb Guardian did nothing. Well, thank fuck for that.

## Withers' office

Withers seemed kind of weak. "Damn... my extra HP pool is gone. I'll have to be careful."
Shaggy asked, "What happens if we *do* lock down the tomb?"
Withers: "From the outside? It'll seal off every room and flood the facility with a deadly neaurotoxin. From the inside, it'll just deploy all our Tomb Guardians to reset the traps."
Shaggy: "Which one are ya feeling?"
Withers: "Well I don't think we have to do a *full* reset..."
Shaggy: "Uh-huh, uh-huh, cool...

Meanwhile, she was inching closer to the door.
When she was close enough, she loosed two arrows at Withers and booked it, slamming the door behind her.

Withers: "Aah! What are you doi-" *(SLAM)*

## Fight

Fortunately, getting shot broke Withers's concentration, so the flame wall vanished!

- Lureene, unable to take another hit like that, disengaged from the Tomb Guardian and strategically retreated behind the cover table.
- Creed attacked the Tomb Guardian and critted!

- Shaggy: "HE'S HERE HE'S HERE HE'S PISSED BUT HE'S HERE"
- Eridian burst into the office and went full Shillelagh on Withers! The Moonbeam disappeared.
- Shaggy moved to a better vantage point, waving to try and get the others' attention.
  "He's here! This way! His office!"
  Creed heard her, Lureene did not.
  Creed: "What? This way, or up the stairs?"
  Shaggy: "No, over here! His office!"
  Lureene: "What's going on?"
  Creed: "She says he's in his office."
  Lureene: "Fuck, he teleported again!"
  Creed: "I'll stay here!"
- Withers started hitting Eridian with his broadsword!
- Lureene booked it out of the combat room, dashing to get to Withers' office as fast as possible.
  Lureene: "Got you now, asshole!"
- Alatu cast Detect Thoughts on Withers.
  She could sense his panic. *How are they in here?!*

- Creed kept poking at the Tomb Guardian, not wanting to get into its melee range.

- Eridian ducked away from Withers. "Hey, Lureene. You want me to heal you, or cast Daylight?"
  Lureene: "Which one's better?"
  Eridian: "Well, he didn't attack when there was Daylight."
  Lureene: "Daylight! Daylight!"
  Eridian cast Daylight.

- Shaggy shot Withers twice. He was within an inch of death -
- Buuut, they were in line formation, and Withers shot his lightning bolt again.
  Lureene and Alatu dropped like a sack of potatoes. Shaggy squeaked by with 1 HP.
- Hearing the lightning, Creed ditched the Tomb Guardian and went after Withers. He didn't quite make it there, so he was standing over Lureene in the doorway.
- Eridian moved in with her Quarterstaff and brained Withers over the head... unceremoniously knocking him *flat*. He ded.

# VICOTORY!

Creed asked Shaggy to help Alatu and Eridian to help Lureene.
Shaggy used a healing potion on Alatu.
  Alatu: "Ah, man! I thought for sure I'd be a ghost that time! Nuts!"
  Shaggy: "Oh, whoops, should I not have revived you?"
  Creed: "No, you should, she's just weird."
  Alatu: "Yeah, that was nice of you. Thanks I guess."

Lureene, healed, got up with a gasp. "Where is he?! I'll tear him limb from limb! I'll-"
Creed: "It's okay, he's down! He's down."
Lureene: "Oh."
  She felt kinda conflicted - on the one hand, *good*, but on the other hand she really wanted to finish him off herself. Nuts.

Creed took off to deal with the remaining tomb guardian, and Lureene followed.
They poked and firebolted it until it collapsed.

# ACTUAL VICOTORY!

Back in the office, Shaggy looted Withers.
- longsword
- black skull amulet
- journal

She flipped through the journal.

It seemed he was interested in goings-on up above, suprisingly.  
It covered a *long* span of time. Some entries were from ancient Omu, even.  
It documented the construction of the tomb, his promotion by Acererak...  
and even notes on the **Soulmonger** and the **Atropal.**

> The master returns with a marvelous gift: a cast-off creation of the gods, dead and yet not. The All-Seeing is blind to its existence, and the Mother of Illusions looks past it! Sweet irony. The master hopes to raise the creature to power by glutting it on souls. The master has brought the Sewn Sisters here to nurse it, and to help build the device needed to feed it. As for me, I am only saddened that my studies shall one day come to an end. I owe the master much for the time he has given me! I can only work harder in the little time that remains for this world.

Lureene investigated the iron maiden (of sorts) again.
"You think this is where they make *all* of 'em?"
Creed: "Maybe?"
Lureene: "Well, even if there's more, one less is still one less."
So she borrowed a knife from Creed and cut the blood tubes and shit feeding it, then beat the crap out of the pistons and mechanical parts until it seemed sufficiently inoperable.
She did get covered in blood as a result, but it was just gross, not dangerous.

Creed: "Who are you?"
Shaggy: "Oh, I'm Shaggy. I grew up in this commune out in the jungle, they had a church where they talked about this Racetrack guy and the end times all the time... I dunno, I didn't go to church a lot. But anyway one day I woke up in the tomb here and this guy Withers found me but I was wearing the commune robes so he thought I was *supposed* to be here and, well, then I ran into you guys, and can I *please* hang out with you, I can't get outta here on my own and Racetrack seems like a really shitty dude..."
(She introduced her animal companion too, though I forget what his name was.)

Alatu was surprised the Book of Clay Golems *wasn't* cursed.
Orvex was like, "Why would it be cursed?"
Alatu: "My Flesh Golem book is cursed."
Creed: "I told you we should destroy it."
Lureene: "Did we not already do that?"
Alatu: "I think my girlfriend still has it. Where *is* Molly, anyway?"

Creed's expression drooped.

Creed: "Why don't you all sit down, we can hang out here, take a rest..."
Lureene *(sensing what's wrong)*: "Creed... Where's Molly?"

With a deep sigh, Creed went over what happened to Molly.
"I tried to get her out, but I couldn't before it decapitated her, and..."
He expressed his close bond with Molly, how they'd known each other even before the campaign, and she really was a close friend and confidante.
"I prepared her body, the way she would have wanted. It's in Repose, so there's no danger of her rising. When we finish resting, we can go down there, pay respects... light her pyre."

Lureene listened, grieving, fists clenching. "Creed... I'm so sorry. If I hadn't run off on my own..."
Creed: "It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault. It's *this place.* Now we just have to press on and finish the job, for her sake."

A brief flash of sadness crossed Alatu's face, but it was rapidly replaced with *anger*.
If she hadn't *quite* tipped over the edge into Evil before, now... now, she was gooone.
  Creed sensed a change in her, but didn't mention it.
  Shaggy offered Alatu herbs from her Herbalism kit and asked if any of them will help. Also, her condolences.

They opted to take a long rest in the office. Shaggy cast Alarm in the hallway just outside, so they'd be alerted if anything chose to fuck with them.

### Loot in the room

- Crystal necklace (Creed)
  *Orvex: "I feel like it controls something, but what...?"*
- Withers
  - Black skull amulet (Shaggy)
    After attuning with it, Shaggy realized it had teleportation properties.
  - Journal (Lureene)
  - Longsword, mundane (Lureene)
  - Studded leather armor, poked with holes (Lureene wears, Eridian mends)
  - Robes (Alatu)
- Manual of Clay Golems (Creed)
- Walls covered in papers with anatomical drawings, sketching of Omuan family trees, etc.
  (It's a bit outdated; Mwaxanare and Na are not on it.)
  Orvex was welcome to take any of those that he found useful.

Some of the papers Orvex couldn't decipher... probably tomb instructions. It'd take scholars to study this.
Shaggy could read some of them - they were in a variety of languages, including Abyssal, Infernal, Deep Speech... the labels included "Cauldron Room" and "Wine Room."
Shaggy: "There's a wine room?? That sounds nice!"
Lureene: "Not when you drown in it."
Shaggy: "That sounds less nice."
 
> ### Amulet of the Black Skull
> Withers wears an Amulet of the Black Skull. The amulet has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, Withers can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport himself and anything he is wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet of him. The destination you choose doesn't need to be in his line of sight, but must be familiar to him (in other words, a place he has seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence. This effect isn't subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods; thus, the amulet can be used to enter and exit the tomb.
