# Events

## Day 44

rations: yes (6 remain)
bugspray: yes (69 remain) (nice)

where to now?
kir sabal.
we retain azaka's services for the next leg of the trip.
    5 g/day, 30 days in advance.
    so we all pitch in 30 gold apiece.
    azaka is hired until day 74.

back down the plateau we go.

creed & lureene try to hunt, but they suck at it.
eridian forages enough for everyone.

uneventful night.

## Day 45

rations: no (6 remain)
bugspray: yes (68 remain)

eastward into the swamp.
around lunch: some pterafolk are circling overhead.
we try to stick to the trees so they can't dive bomb us.
the pterafolk continue following us all day.

lureene tries a snare but can't catch anything.
then she gets ambushed by pterafolk!
    creed gets grappled, but lureene pulls the guy off him.
    eridian and alatu blast two with spells, azaka stabs one. a fifth is circling overhead...
    eridian zaps one... while lureene is holding it! lureene also takes a bunch of lightning damage.

watch scheme:
- 1st watch: eridian, creed assisting
    finds "nesferato". potion that gives nightmares for 1d3 months when injected.
        300gp for the right buyer.
- 2nd watch: alatu, lureene assisting

## Day 46

rations: no (6 remain)
bugspray: yes (67 remain)

azaka is confused in the morning, but gets the right path eventually.
we hit the river. some people are coming our way.
    priestly looking - they're 100 yards away, on our side of the river.

    aman - priest
    kaal - cloth robes
    oui - leather armor and a bow
    3 tribal warriors, not speaking

they're looking for orolunga, and want to be the first to find it.
they've been hired to bring back the oracle to nyanzaru,
    and they think this would constitute "rescuing" her.
but they've been going around in circles for 120 days.
we talk them out of continuing, and they start heading back to Port Nyanzaru, dejected.

in hunting, creed broke his crossbrow string.
he tried to fix it by unraveling a rope, but it didn't work, so he lost the rope as well.


## Day 47

rations: yes (5 remain)
bugspray: yes (66 remain)

torrential downpour: too hard to continue.
we stay in camp for the day, playing cards & dice, and drinking beer from our alchemy jug.
Lureene has a little too much to drink.

meanwhile, assassin vines are creeping toward our campsite!
lureene went down, because she was trying to fight drunk. but we beat them.

overnight, eridian finds a plant.
    dar'nal: can be made into eyedrops that give darkvision for 1 hour. sells for 85 gp.


## Day 48

rations: no (5 remain)
bugspray: yes (65 remain)

light rain. nothing much happens today.
lureene tries to do trapping again but still fails.

eridian finds a plant that can be made into a "+2 to seduction" potion.


## Day 49

rations: no (5 remain)
bugspray: yes (64 remain)

first thing in the morning:
three fat rabbits appear in camp!
everyone's about to eat them, but eridian sees they are messengers.
casts speak to animals.

they inform us that sindra is under house arrest (quarantine)
and the merchant princes are driving commoners out of the city.
