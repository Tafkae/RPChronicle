*Our heroes seek supplies, and instead get conscripted; they resist arrest, but are arrested anyway; and Eridian accidentally does a war crime*

# Events

## *Day 25*

* Rations consumed: no (13 remain - Eridian & Creed foraged)
* Bug spray consumed: yes (22 remain)

At dawn, a goblin appeared and *almost* sounded an alarm, but then tripped over his own feet and broke his horn.

The party took the boats they found at Camp Righteous and sailed down the river to Camp Vengeance to resupply. The trip took two days (25-27). Four people per boat.

## *Day 26*

* Rations consumed: no (13 remain)
* Bug spray consumed: yes (21 remain)

## *Day 27*

* Rations consumed: ???
* Bug spray consumed: yes (20 remain)

Azaka and Dennis opted to stay a little ways down the river because paladins (who run Camp V.) don't like goblins or Azaka. So the party currently is Creed, Molly, Eridian, Alatu, and Lureene.

They reached Camp Vengeance, which was much better fortified than Camp Righteous, with a wooden palisade and a ditch full of wooden spikes. The area outside the fort was littered with charred corpses and flayed animals. The paladins at the gate were annoyed, but one stepped back to ask if they could come in and resupply. The second guard looked exhausted, but denied anything was wrong.

Lureene examined the corpses, but couldn't figure out if they started out undead. They appeared to have been burned by regular, non-magical fire.

The paladins opened the gate, where some asshole in gleaming gold armor met the party. He introduced himself as Commander Niles Breakbone of the Order of the Gauntlet, whose mission is to rid the world of the undead. And he informed the party that they were being conscripted to work for *him*, effective immediately.

Meanwhile, Creed and Eridian were starting to realize something was *very wrong* here. The camp was in disarray, filthy, no supplies. Eridian pointed out the sewage, and the Commander waved off her concerns. He refused to listen.

Lureene and Creed put their foot down, politely, but this made the Commander very angry. He put his hand on his sword and told them, "If you don't join us, you're under arrest." He then called out eight additional paladins to arrest them.

**Good Guys:** Lureene, Eridian, Creed, Alatu, Molly (5)  
**Bad Guys:** Commander Breakbone; 2x Silver Paladin; 1x Priestess; lots of Veteran Paladins, Tired Paladins, and Ragged Paladins

* Alatu intimidated three of the Paladins into deserting on the spot. (After the fight, someone went up and summarily executed all three.)
* Commander Breakbone ran away like a fucking sissy-ass coward, sending out two super shiny swole silver paladins to fight in his place. Lureene moved to intercept these guys.
* A woman in super fine robes emerged from a tent just long enough to dispel Eridian's Moonbeam before disappearing back inside.
* At some point Molly was knocked unconscious, but the enemy medic stabilized her.
* Eridian killed some sick and injured people by re-casting Moonbeam *into* the medical tent. This also seriously wounded the medic.
* Lureene briefly evaded her attackers by jumping into the goat pen, but was cornered.
* Breakbone raised the alarm, causing 30-odd more paladins to emerge and surround them.

Sooo overall the battle did not go in the party's favor. They were outnumbered, surrounded, and forced to surrender. Alatu's silver tongue managed to convince some folks that maybe the *paladins* could join the *party* on *their* quest - they didn't agree, but they said they'd hear the party out. Their weapons confiscated, they were brought before Commander Breakbone in his coward tent...
